# 1208. Get Equal Substrings Within Budget

**Tags:** String, Binary Search, Sliding Window, Prefix Sum
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/get-equal-substrings-within-budget/

## Description

You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length and an integer `maxCost`.

You want to change `s` to `t`. Changing the `i^th` character of `s` to `i^th` character of `t` costs `|s[i] - t[i]|` (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).

Return *the maximum length of a substring of *`s`* that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of *`t`* with a cost less than or equal to *`maxCost`. If there is no substring from `s` that can be changed to its corresponding substring from `t`, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** "abc" of s can change to "bcd".
That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** Each character in s costs 2 to change to character in t,  so the maximum length is 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** You cannot make any change, so the maximum length is 1.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
	- `t.length == s.length`
	- `0 <= maxCost <= 10^6`
	- `s` and `t` consist of only lowercase English letters.

## Hints

1. Calculate the differences between s[i] and t[i].
2. Use a sliding window to track the longest valid substring.

## Test Cases

```
"abcd"
"bcdf"
3
---
"abcd"
"cdef"
3
---
"abcd"
"acde"
0
---
```
