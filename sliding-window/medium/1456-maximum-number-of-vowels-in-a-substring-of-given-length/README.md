**Tags:** String, Sliding Window
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-vowels-in-a-substring-of-given-length/

## Description

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return *the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of *`s`* with length *`k`.

**Vowel letters** in English are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** s = "abciiidef", k = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The substring "iii" contains 3 vowel letters.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** s = "aeiou", k = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Any substring of length 2 contains 2 vowels.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** s = "leetcode", k = 3
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** "lee", "eet" and "ode" contain 2 vowels.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
	- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
	- `1 <= k <= s.length`

## Hints

1. Keep a window of size k and maintain the number of vowels in it.
2. Keep moving the window and update the number of vowels while moving. Answer is max number of vowels of any window.
