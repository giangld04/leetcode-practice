# 316. Remove Duplicate Letters

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** String, Stack, Greedy, Monotonic Stack
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicate-letters/

## Description

Given a string `s`, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is **the smallest in lexicographical order** among all possible results.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** s = "bcabc"
**Output:** "abc"
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** s = "cbacdcbc"
**Output:** "acdb"
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
	- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

**Note:** This question is the same as 1081: https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subsequence-of-distinct-characters/

## Hints

1. Greedily try to add one missing character. How to check if adding some character will not cause problems ? Use bit-masks to check whether you will be able to complete the sub-sequence if you add the character at some index i.

## Test Cases

```
"bcabc"
---
"cbacdcbc"
---
```
