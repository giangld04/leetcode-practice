**Tags:** Tree, Depth-First Search, Binary Search Tree, Sorting, Binary Tree
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/all-elements-in-two-binary-search-trees/

## Description

Given two binary search trees `root1` and `root2`, return *a list containing all the integers from both trees sorted in **ascending** order*.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** root1 = [2,1,4], root2 = [1,0,3]
**Output:** [0,1,1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** root1 = [1,null,8], root2 = [8,1]
**Output:** [1,1,8,8]
```

**Constraints:**

	- The number of nodes in each tree is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
	- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

## Hints

1. Traverse the first tree in list1 and the second tree in list2.
2. Merge the two trees in one list and sort it.

## Test Cases

```
[2,1,4]
[1,0,3]
---
[1,null,8]
[8,1]
---
```
