## Description

You are given an integer `n`. There is an **undirected** graph with `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` denotes that there exists an **undirected** edge connecting nodes `a_i` and `b_i`.

Return *the **number of pairs** of different nodes that are **unreachable** from each other*.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There are no pairs of nodes that are unreachable from each other. Therefore, we return 0.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** n = 7, edges = [[0,2],[0,5],[2,4],[1,6],[5,4]]
**Output:** 14
**Explanation:** There are 14 pairs of nodes that are unreachable from each other:
[[0,1],[0,3],[0,6],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6],[3,4],[3,5],[3,6],[4,6],[5,6]].
Therefore, we return 14.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
	- `0 <= edges.length <= 2 * 10^5`
	- `edges[i].length == 2`
	- `0 <= a_i, b_i < n`
	- `a_i != b_i`
	- There are no repeated edges.

## Hints

1. Find the connected components of the graph. To find connected components, you can use Union Find (Disjoint Sets), BFS, or DFS.
2. For a node u, the number of nodes that are unreachable from u is the number of nodes that are not in the same connected component as u.
3. The number of unreachable nodes from node u will be the same for the number of nodes that are unreachable from node v if nodes u and v belong to the same connected component.

## Test Cases

```

[[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]
