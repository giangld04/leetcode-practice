# 207. Course Schedule

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Graph Theory, Topological Sort
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/

## Description

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that you **must** take course `b_i` first if you want to take course `a_i`.

	- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
	- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
	- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
	- `0 <= a_i, b_i < numCourses`
	- All the pairs prerequisites[i] are **unique**.

## Hints

1. This problem is equivalent to finding if a cycle exists in a directed graph. If a cycle exists, no topological ordering exists and therefore it will be impossible to take all courses.
2. Topological Sort via DFS - A great tutorial explaining the basic concepts of Topological Sort.
3. Topological sort could also be done via BFS.
