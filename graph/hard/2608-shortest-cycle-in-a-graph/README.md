# 2608. Shortest Cycle in a Graph

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** Breadth-First Search, Graph Theory
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-cycle-in-a-graph/

## Description

There is a **bi-directional **graph with `n` vertices, where each vertex is labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. The edges in the graph are represented by a given 2D integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` denotes an edge between vertex `u_i` and vertex `v_i`. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.

Return *the length of the **shortest **cycle in the graph*. If no cycle exists, return `-1`.

A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node, and each edge in the path is used only once.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[6,3]]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The cycle with the smallest length is : 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There are no cycles in this graph.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= n <= 1000`
	- `1 <= edges.length <= 1000`
	- `edges[i].length == 2`
	- `0 <= u_i, v_i < n`
	- `u_i != v_i`
	- There are no repeated edges.

## Hints

1. How can BFS be used?
2. For each vertex u, calculate the length of the shortest cycle that contains vertex u using BFS

## Test Cases

```
7
[[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[6,3]]
---
4
[[0,1],[0,2]]
