**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** String, Dynamic Programming, Bit Manipulation, Graph Theory, Bitmask
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-path-in-graph/

## Description

You are given an integer `n` and an **undirected** graph with `n` nodes labeled from 0 to `n - 1` and a 2D array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates an edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i`.

You are also given a string `label` of length `n`, where `label[i]` is the character associated with node `i`.

You may start at any node and move to any adjacent node, visiting each node **at most** once.

Return the **maximum** possible length of a **palindrome** that can be formed by visiting a set of **unique** nodes along a valid path.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], label = "aba"

**Output:** 3

**Exp****lanation:**

	- The longest palindromic path is from node 0 to node 2 via node 1, following the path `0 → 1 → 2` forming string `"aba"`.
	- This is a valid palindrome of length 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], label = "abc"

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

	- No path with more than one node forms a palindrome.
	- The best option is any single node, giving a palindrome of length 1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,2],[0,3],[3,1]], label = "bbac"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

	- The longest palindromic path is from node 0 to node 1, following the path `0 → 3 → 1`, forming string `"bcb"`.
	- This is a valid palindrome of length 3.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 14`
	- `n - 1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
	- `edges[i] == [u_i, v_i]`
	- `0 <= u_i, v_i <= n - 1`
	- `u_i != v_i`
	- `label.length == n`
	- `label` consists of lowercase English letters.
	- There are no duplicate edges.

## Hints

1. Use bitmask dynamic programming.
2. Build the palindrome by expanding from both endpoints: you can include a new pair of nodes as endpoints if neither is already in the current bitmask mask.
3. Before adding new endpoints to the current palindrome, ensure their labels match the labels at the previous endpoints prev_l and prev_r.
4. Memoize each state as dp[mask][prev_l][prev_r], representing the maximum palindrome length achievable using the set of visited nodes in mask with current endpoints at prev_l and prev_r.

## Test Cases

```

[[0,1],[1,2]]
"aba"

3
[[0,1],[0,2]]
"abc"

4
[[0,2],[0,3],[3,1]]
"bbac"

```
