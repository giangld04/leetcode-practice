# 777. Swap Adjacent in LR String

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Two Pointers, String
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-adjacent-in-lr-string/

## Description

In a string composed of `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'X'` characters, like `"RXXLRXRXL"`, a move consists of either replacing one occurrence of `"XL"` with `"LX"`, or replacing one occurrence of `"RX"` with `"XR"`. Given the starting string `start` and the ending string `result`, return `True` if and only if there exists a sequence of moves to transform `start` to `result`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** start = "RXXLRXRXL", result = "XRLXXRRLX"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** We can transform start to result following these steps:
RXXLRXRXL ->
XRXLRXRXL ->
XRLXRXRXL ->
XRLXXRRXL ->
XRLXXRRLX
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** start = "X", result = "L"
**Output:** false
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= start.length <= 10^4`
	- `start.length == result.length`
	- Both `start` and `result` will only consist of characters in `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'X'`.

## Hints

1. Think of the L and R's as people on a horizontal line, where X is a space.  The people can't cross each other, and also you can't go from XRX to RXX.

## Test Cases

```
"RXXLRXRXL"
"XRLXXRRLX"
---
"X"
"L"
---
```
