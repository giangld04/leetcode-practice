**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Linked List, Two Pointers, Stack, Recursion
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/

## Description

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

```
L_0 → L_1 → … → L_n - 1 → L_n
```

*Reorder the list to be on the following form:*

```
L_0 → L_n → L_1 → L_n - 1 → L_2 → L_n - 2 → …
```

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4]
**Output:** [1,4,2,3]
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5]
**Output:** [1,5,2,4,3]
```

**Constraints:**

	- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 5 * 10^4]`.
	- `1 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Test Cases

```
[1,2,3,4]
---
[1,2,3,4,5]
---
```
