# 1721. Swapping Nodes in a Linked List

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Linked List, Two Pointers
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/swapping-nodes-in-a-linked-list/

## Description

You are given the `head` of a linked list, and an integer `k`.

Return *the head of the linked list after **swapping** the values of the *`k^th` *node from the beginning and the *`k^th` *node from the end (the list is **1-indexed**).*

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
**Output:** [1,4,3,2,5]
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** head = [7,9,6,6,7,8,3,0,9,5], k = 5
**Output:** [7,9,6,6,8,7,3,0,9,5]
```

**Constraints:**

	- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
	- `1 <= k <= n <= 10^5`
	- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Hints

1. We can traverse the linked list and store the elements in an array.
2. Upon conversion to an array, we can swap the required elements by indexing the array.
3. We can rebuild the linked list using the order of the elements in the array.

## Test Cases

```
[1,2,3,4,5]
2
---
[7,9,6,6,7,8,3,0,9,5]
5
---
```
