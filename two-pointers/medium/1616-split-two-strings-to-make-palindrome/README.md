# 1616. Split Two Strings to Make Palindrome

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Two Pointers, String
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/split-two-strings-to-make-palindrome/

## Description

You are given two strings `a` and `b` of the same length. Choose an index and split both strings **at the same index**, splitting `a` into two strings: `a_prefix` and `a_suffix` where `a = a_prefix + a_suffix`, and splitting `b` into two strings: `b_prefix` and `b_suffix` where `b = b_prefix + b_suffix`. Check if `a_prefix + b_suffix` or `b_prefix + a_suffix` forms a palindrome.

When you split a string `s` into `s_prefix` and `s_suffix`, either `s_suffix` or `s_prefix` is allowed to be empty. For example, if `s = "abc"`, then `"" + "abc"`, `"a" + "bc"`, `"ab" + "c"` , and `"abc" + ""` are valid splits.

Return `true`* if it is possible to form** a palindrome string, otherwise return *`false`.

**Notice** that `x + y` denotes the concatenation of strings `x` and `y`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** a = "x", b = "y"
**Output:** true
**Explaination:** If either a or b are palindromes the answer is true since you can split in the following way:
a_prefix = "", a_suffix = "x"
b_prefix = "", b_suffix = "y"
Then, a_prefix + b_suffix = "" + "y" = "y", which is a palindrome.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** a = "xbdef", b = "xecab"
**Output:** false
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** a = "ulacfd", b = "jizalu"
**Output:** true
**Explaination:** Split them at index 3:
a_prefix = "ula", a_suffix = "cfd"
b_prefix = "jiz", b_suffix = "alu"
Then, a_prefix + b_suffix = "ula" + "alu" = "ulaalu", which is a palindrome.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^5`
	- `a.length == b.length`
	- `a` and `b` consist of lowercase English letters

## Hints

1. Try finding the largest prefix from a that matches a suffix in b
2. Try string matching

## Test Cases

```
"x"
"y"
---
"xbdef"
"xecab"
---
"ulacfd"
"jizalu"
---
```
