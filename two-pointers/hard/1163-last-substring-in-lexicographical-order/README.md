# 1163. Last Substring in Lexicographical Order

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** Two Pointers, String
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/last-substring-in-lexicographical-order/

## Description

Given a string `s`, return *the last substring of* `s` *in lexicographical order*.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** s = "abab"
**Output:** "bab"
**Explanation:** The substrings are ["a", "ab", "aba", "abab", "b", "ba", "bab"]. The lexicographically maximum substring is "bab".
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** s = "leetcode"
**Output:** "tcode"
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 4 * 10^5`
	- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

## Hints

1. Assume that the answer is a sub-string from index i to j. If you add the character at index j+1 you get a better answer.
2. The answer is always a suffix of the given string.
3. Since the limits are high, we need an efficient data structure.
4. Use suffix array.

## Test Cases

```
"abab"

"leetcode"
