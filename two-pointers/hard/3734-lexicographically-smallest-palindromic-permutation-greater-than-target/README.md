# 3734. Lexicographically Smallest Palindromic Permutation Greater Than Target

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** Two Pointers, String, Enumeration
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/lexicographically-smallest-palindromic-permutation-greater-than-target/

## Description

You are given two strings `s` and `target`, each of length `n`, consisting of lowercase English letters.

Return the **lexicographically smallest string** that is **both** a **palindromic permutation** of `s` and **strictly** greater than `target`. If no such permutation exists, return an empty string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "baba", target = "abba"

**Output:** "baab"

**Explanation:**

	- The palindromic permutations of `s` (in lexicographical order) are `"abba"` and `"baab"`.
	- The lexicographically smallest permutation that is strictly greater than `target` is `"baab"`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "baba", target = "bbaa"

**Output:** ""

**Explanation:**

	- The palindromic permutations of `s` (in lexicographical order) are `"abba"` and `"baab"`.
	- None of them is lexicographically strictly greater than `target`. Therefore, the answer is `""`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "abc", target = "abb"

**Output:** ""

**Explanation:**

`s` has no palindromic permutations. Therefore, the answer is `""`.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s = "aac", target = "abb"

**Output:** "aca"

**Explanation:**

	- The only palindromic permutation of `s` is `"aca"`.
	- `"aca"` is strictly greater than `target`. Therefore, the answer is `"aca"`.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n == s.length == target.length <= 300`
	- `s` and `target` consist of only lowercase English letters.

## Hints

1. A palindromic permutation exists only if at most one character has an odd count (for odd-length strings) or all counts are even (for even-length strings).
2. Focus on constructing the first half of the palindrome. The second half is determined by mirroring.
3. To be lexicographically greater than target, the first half must be greater than or equal to target's first half, with careful handling of the middle character for odd-length strings.
4. Use a backtracking approach or greedy selection for each position in the first half, trying the smallest available character that can still produce a valid palindrome.
5. After building the first half, mirror it (and add the middle character if needed) to form the full palindrome and verify it is strictly greater than target.
