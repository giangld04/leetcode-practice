## Description

Given a `sentence` that consists of some words separated by a **single space**, and a `searchWord`, check if `searchWord` is a prefix of any word in `sentence`.

Return *the index of the word in *`sentence`* (**1-indexed**) where *`searchWord`* is a prefix of this word*. If `searchWord` is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word **(minimum index)**. If there is no such word return `-1`.

A **prefix** of a string `s` is any leading contiguous substring of `s`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** sentence = "i love eating burger", searchWord = "burg"
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** "burg" is prefix of "burger" which is the 4th word in the sentence.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** sentence = "this problem is an easy problem", searchWord = "pro"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** "pro" is prefix of "problem" which is the 2nd and the 6th word in the sentence, but we return 2 as it's the minimal index.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** sentence = "i am tired", searchWord = "you"
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** "you" is not a prefix of any word in the sentence.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= sentence.length <= 100`
	- `1 <= searchWord.length <= 10`
	- `sentence` consists of lowercase English letters and spaces.
	- `searchWord` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Hints

1. First extract the words of the sentence.
2. Check for each word if searchWord occurs at index 0, if so return the index of this word (1-indexed)
3. If searchWord doesn't exist as a prefix of any word return the default value (-1).

## Test Cases

```
"i love eating burger"
"burg"
---
"this problem is an easy problem"
"pro"
---
"i am tired"
"you"
---
```
