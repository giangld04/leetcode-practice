## Description

You are given two positive integers `n` and `k`.

Return an integer denoting the `n^th` smallest positive integer that has **exactly** `k` ones in its binary representation. It is guaranteed that the answer is **strictly less** than `2^50`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, k = 2

**Output:** 9

**Explanation:**

The 4 smallest positive integers that have exactly `k = 2` ones in their binary representations are:

	- `3 = 11_2`
	- `5 = 101_2`
	- `6 = 110_2`
	- `9 = 1001_2`

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, k = 1

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

The 3 smallest positive integers that have exactly `k = 1` one in their binary representations are:

	- `1 = 1_2`
	- `2 = 10_2`
	- `4 = 100_2`

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 2^50`
	- `1 <= k <= 50`
	- The answer is strictly less than `2^50`.

## Hints

1. Since the answer is strictly less than 250, we can iterate over the number of bits (the length) of the result.
2. Precompute binomial coefficients C(n, k) to count how many numbers with exactly k set bits exist for a given length.
3. Determine the position of the most significant bit first, then greedily determine the remaining bits from MSB to LSB based on the remaining count n.
