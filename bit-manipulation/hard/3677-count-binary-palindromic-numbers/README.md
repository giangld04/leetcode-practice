# 3677. Count Binary Palindromic Numbers

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** Math, Bit Manipulation
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-binary-palindromic-numbers/

## Description

You are given a **non-negative** integer `n`.

A **non-negative** integer is called **binary-palindromic** if its binary representation (written without leading zeros) reads the same forward and backward.

Return the number of integers `k` such that `0 <= k <= n` and the binary representation of `k` is a palindrome.

**Note:** The number 0 is considered binary-palindromic, and its representation is `"0"`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 9

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

The integers `k` in the range `[0, 9]` whose binary representations are palindromes are:

	- `0 → "0"`
	- `1 → "1"`
	- `3 → "11"`
	- `5 → "101"`
	- `7 → "111"`
	- `9 → "1001"`

All other values in `[0, 9]` have non-palindromic binary forms. Therefore, the count is 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 0

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

Since `"0"` is a palindrome, the count is 1.

**Constraints:**

	- `0 <= n <= 10^15`

## Hints

1. Try to think in terms of binary string length rather than brute forcing all numbers .
2. How many binary palindromes exist for a given length L? (only the first half determines the whole number.)
3. You can pre-count all palindromes of length  directly using powers of 2.
4. For palindromes of length = len(n), extract the prefix of n, mirror it, and check if it exceeds n.
