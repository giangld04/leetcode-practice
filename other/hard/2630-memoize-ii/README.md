## Description

Given a function `fn`, return a **memoized** version of that function.

A **memoized **function is a function that will never be called twice with the same inputs. Instead it will return a cached value.

`fn` can be any function and there are no constraints on what type of values it accepts. Inputs are considered identical if they are `===` to each other.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** 
getInputs = () => [[2,2],[2,2],[1,2]]
fn = function (a, b) { return a + b; }
**Output:** [{"val":4,"calls":1},{"val":4,"calls":1},{"val":3,"calls":2}]
**Explanation:**
const inputs = getInputs();
const memoized = memoize(fn);
for (const arr of inputs) {
  memoized(...arr);
}

For the inputs of (2, 2): 2 + 2 = 4, and it required a call to fn().
For the inputs of (2, 2): 2 + 2 = 4, but those inputs were seen before so no call to fn() was required.
For the inputs of (1, 2): 1 + 2 = 3, and it required another call to fn() for a total of 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** 
getInputs = () => [[{},{}],[{},{}],[{},{}]] 
fn = function (a, b) { return ({...a, ...b}); }
**Output:** [{"val":{},"calls":1},{"val":{},"calls":2},{"val":{},"calls":3}]
**Explanation:**
Merging two empty objects will always result in an empty object. It may seem like there should only be 1 call to fn() because of cache-hits, however none of those objects are === to each other.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** 
getInputs = () => { const o = {}; return [[o,o],[o,o],[o,o]]; }
fn = function (a, b) { return ({...a, ...b}); }
**Output:** [{"val":{},"calls":1},{"val":{},"calls":1},{"val":{},"calls":1}]
**Explanation:**
Merging two empty objects will always result in an empty object. The 2nd and 3rd third function calls result in a cache-hit. This is because every object passed in is identical.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= inputs.length <= 10^5`
	- `0 <= inputs.flat().length <= 10^5`
	- `inputs[i][j] != NaN`

## Hints

1. Just because JSON.stringify(obj1) === JSON.stringify(obj2), doesn't necessarily mean obj1 === obj2.
2. You could iterate over all previously passed inputs to check if there has been a match. However, that will be very slow.
3. Javascript Maps are a could way to associate arbitrary data.
4. Make a tree structure of Maps. The depth of the tree should match the number of input parameters.

## Test Cases

```
() => [[2,2],[2,2],[1,2]]
function (a, b) { return a + b; }
---
() => [[{},{}],[{},{}],[{},{}]]
function (a, b) { return ({...a, ...b}); }
---
() => { const o = {}; return [[o,o],[o,o],[o,o]]; }
function (a, b) { return ({...a, ...b}); }
---
```
