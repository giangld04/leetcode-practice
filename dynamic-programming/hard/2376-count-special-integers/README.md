# 2376. Count Special Integers

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** Math, Dynamic Programming
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-special-integers/

## Description

We call a positive integer **special** if all of its digits are **distinct**.

Given a **positive** integer `n`, return *the number of special integers that belong to the interval *`[1, n]`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** n = 20
**Output:** 19
**Explanation:** All the integers from 1 to 20, except 11, are special. Thus, there are 19 special integers.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** n = 5
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** All the integers from 1 to 5 are special.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** n = 135
**Output:** 110
**Explanation:** There are 110 integers from 1 to 135 that are special.
Some of the integers that are not special are: 22, 114, and 131.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^9`

## Hints

1. Try to think of dynamic programming.
2. Use the idea of digit dynamic programming to build the numbers, in addition to a bitmask that will tell which digits you have used so far on the number that you are building.

## Test Cases
