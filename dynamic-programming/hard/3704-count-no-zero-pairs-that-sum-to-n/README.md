# 3704. Count No-Zero Pairs That Sum to N

**Difficulty:** Hard

## Description

A **no-zero** integer is a **positive** integer that **does not contain the digit** 0 in its decimal representation.

Given an integer `n`, count the number of pairs `(a, b)` where:

	- `a` and `b` are **no-zero** integers.
	- `a + b = n`

Return an integer denoting the number of such pairs.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

The only pair is `(1, 1)`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The pairs are `(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 11

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:**

The pairs are `(2, 9)`, `(3, 8)`, `(4, 7)`, `(5, 6)`, `(6, 5)`, `(7, 4)`, `(8, 3)`, and `(9, 2)`. Note that `(1, 10)` and `(10, 1)` do not satisfy the conditions because 10 contains 0 in its decimal representation.

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= n <= 10^15`

## Hints

1. Use digit DP over the decimal representation of n.
2. At each digit, track whether a carry is present and whether a or b has used a zero so far.
3. Transition by choosing digits for a and b that add up (with carry) to the current digit of n.
4. Subtract the cases where either number ends up being zero-containing when n itself is no-zero.
