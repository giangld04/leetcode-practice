# 1611. Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** Math, Dynamic Programming, Bit Manipulation, Recursion, Memoization
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-one-bit-operations-to-make-integers-zero/

## Description

Given an integer `n`, you must transform it into `0` using the following operations any number of times:

	- Change the rightmost (`0^th`) bit in the binary representation of `n`.
	- Change the `i^th` bit in the binary representation of `n` if the `(i-1)^th` bit is set to `1` and the `(i-2)^th` through `0^th` bits are set to `0`.

Return *the minimum number of operations to transform *`n`* into *`0`*.*

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** n = 3
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The binary representation of 3 is "11".
"11" -> "01" with the 2^nd operation since the 0^th bit is 1.
"01" -> "00" with the 1^st operation.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** n = 6
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The binary representation of 6 is "110".
"110" -> "010" with the 2^nd operation since the 1^st bit is 1 and 0^th through 0^th bits are 0.
"010" -> "011" with the 1^st operation.
"011" -> "001" with the 2^nd operation since the 0^th bit is 1.
"001" -> "000" with the 1^st operation.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `0 <= n <= 10^9`

## Hints

1. The fastest way to convert n to zero is to remove all set bits starting from the leftmost one. Try some simple examples to learn the rule of how many steps are needed to remove one set bit.
2. consider n=2^k case first, then solve for all n.
