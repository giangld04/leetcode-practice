# 3260. Find the Largest Palindrome Divisible by K

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** Math, String, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Number Theory
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-largest-palindrome-divisible-by-k/

## Description

You are given two **positive** integers `n` and `k`.

An integer `x` is called **k-palindromic** if:

	- `x` is a palindrome.
	- `x` is divisible by `k`.

Return the** largest** integer having `n` digits (as a string) that is **k-palindromic**.

**Note** that the integer must **not** have leading zeros.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, k = 5

**Output:** "595"

**Explanation:**

595 is the largest k-palindromic integer with 3 digits.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1, k = 4

**Output:** "8"

**Explanation:**

4 and 8 are the only k-palindromic integers with 1 digit.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 5, k = 6

**Output:** "89898"

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= k <= 9`

## Hints

1. It must have a solution since we can have all digits equal to k.
2. Use string dp, store modulus along with length of number currently formed.
3. Is it possible to solve greedily using divisibility rules?
