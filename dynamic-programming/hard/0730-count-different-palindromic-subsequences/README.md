# 730. Count Different Palindromic Subsequences

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** String, Dynamic Programming
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-different-palindromic-subsequences/

## Description

Given a string s, return *the number of different non-empty palindromic subsequences in* `s`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

A subsequence of a string is obtained by deleting zero or more characters from the string.

A sequence is palindromic if it is equal to the sequence reversed.

Two sequences `a_1, a_2, ...` and `b_1, b_2, ...` are different if there is some `i` for which `a_i != b_i`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** s = "bccb"
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The 6 different non-empty palindromic subsequences are 'b', 'c', 'bb', 'cc', 'bcb', 'bccb'.
Note that 'bcb' is counted only once, even though it occurs twice.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** s = "abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcddcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcba"
**Output:** 104860361
**Explanation:** There are 3104860382 different non-empty palindromic subsequences, which is 104860361 modulo 10^9 + 7.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
	- `s[i]` is either `'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`, or `'d'`.

## Hints

1. Let dp(i, j) be the answer for the string T = S[i:j+1] including the empty sequence. The answer is the number of unique characters in T, plus palindromes of the form "a_a", "b_b", "c_c", and "d_d", where "_" represents zero or more characters.

## Test Cases

```
