# 2571. Minimum Operations to Reduce an Integer to 0

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Bit Manipulation
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-reduce-an-integer-to-0/

## Description

You are given a positive integer `n`, you can do the following operation **any** number of times:

	- Add or subtract a **power** of `2` from `n`.

Return *the **minimum** number of operations to make *`n`* equal to *`0`.

A number `x` is power of `2` if `x == 2^i` where `i >= 0`*.*

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** n = 39
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We can do the following operations:
- Add 2^0 = 1 to n, so now n = 40.
- Subtract 2^3 = 8 from n, so now n = 32.
- Subtract 2^5 = 32 from n, so now n = 0.
It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of operations we need to make n equal to 0.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** n = 54
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We can do the following operations:
- Add 2^1 = 2 to n, so now n = 56.
- Add 2^3 = 8 to n, so now n = 64.
- Subtract 2^6 = 64 from n, so now n = 0.
So the minimum number of operations is 3.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 10^5`

## Hints

1. Can we set/unset the bits in binary representation?
2. If there are multiple adjacent ones, how can we optimally add and subtract in 2 operations such that all ones get unset?
3. Bonus: Try to solve the problem with higher constraints: n ≤ 10^18.
