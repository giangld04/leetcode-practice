# 3747. Count Distinct Integers After Removing Zeros

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Math, Dynamic Programming
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-distinct-integers-after-removing-zeros/

## Description

You are given a **positive** integer `n`.

For every integer `x` from 1 to `n`, we write down the integer obtained by removing all zeros from the decimal representation of `x`.

Return an integer denoting the number of **distinct** integers written down.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 10

**Output:** 9

**Explanation:**

The integers we wrote down are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1. There are 9 distinct integers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

The integers we wrote down are 1, 2, 3. There are 3 distinct integers (1, 2, 3).

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 10^15`

## Hints

1. Build integers less than or equal to n using only digits from 1 to 9
2. Count such integers using math or digit DP
