## Description

There is an undirected weighted connected graph. You are given a positive integer `n` which denotes that the graph has `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, and an array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, weight_i]` denotes that there is an edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i` with weight equal to `weight_i`.

A path from node `start` to node `end` is a sequence of nodes `[z_0, z_1,_ z_2, ..., z_k]` such that `z_0 = start` and `z_k = end` and there is an edge between `z_i` and `z_i+1` where `0 <= i <= k-1`.

The distance of a path is the sum of the weights on the edges of the path. Let `distanceToLastNode(x)` denote the shortest distance of a path between node `n` and node `x`. A **restricted path** is a path that also satisfies that `distanceToLastNode(z_i) > distanceToLastNode(z_i+1)` where `0 <= i <= k-1`.

Return *the number of restricted paths from node* `1` *to node* `n`. Since that number may be too large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** n = 5, edges = [[1,2,3],[1,3,3],[2,3,1],[1,4,2],[5,2,2],[3,5,1],[5,4,10]]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Each circle contains the node number in black and its `distanceToLastNode value in blue. `The three restricted paths are:
1) 1 --> 2 --> 5
2) 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 5
3) 1 --> 3 --> 5
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** n = 7, edges = [[1,3,1],[4,1,2],[7,3,4],[2,5,3],[5,6,1],[6,7,2],[7,5,3],[2,6,4]]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** Each circle contains the node number in black and its `distanceToLastNode value in blue. `The only restricted path is 1 --> 3 --> 7.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`
	- `n - 1 <= edges.length <= 4 * 10^4`
	- `edges[i].length == 3`
	- `1 <= u_i, v_i <= n`
	- `u_i != v_i`
	- `1 <= weight_i <= 10^5`
	- There is at most one edge between any two nodes.
	- There is at least one path between any two nodes.

## Hints

1. Run a Dijkstra from node numbered n to compute distance from the last node.
2. Consider all edges [u, v] one by one and direct them such that distance of u to n > distance of v to n. If both u and v are at the same distance from n, discard this edge.
3. Now this problem reduces to computing the number of paths from 1 to n in a DAG, a standard DP problem.
