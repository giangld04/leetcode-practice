## Description

You are given an integer `n` and a **directed** graph with `n` nodes labeled from 0 to `n - 1`. This is represented by a 2D array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, start_i, end_i]` indicates an edge from node `u_i` to `v_i` that can **only** be used at any integer time `t` such that `start_i <= t <= end_i`.

You start at node 0 at time 0.

In one unit of time, you can either:

	- Wait at your current node without moving, or
	- Travel along an outgoing edge from your current node if the current time `t` satisfies `start_i <= t <= end_i`.

Return the **minimum** time required to reach node `n - 1`. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1,0,1],[1,2,2,5]]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

The optimal path is:

	- At time `t = 0`, take the edge `(0 → 1)` which is available from 0 to 1. You arrive at node 1 at time `t = 1`, then wait until `t = 2`.
	- At time `t = 2`, take the edge `(1 → 2)` which is available from 2 to 5. You arrive at node 2 at time 3.

Hence, the minimum time to reach node 2 is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,1,0,3],[1,3,7,8],[0,2,1,5],[2,3,4,7]]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

The optimal path is:

	- Wait at node 0 until time `t = 1`, then take the edge `(0 → 2)` which is available from 1 to 5. You arrive at node 2 at `t = 2`.
	- Wait at node 2 until time `t = 4`, then take the edge `(2 → 3)` which is available from 4 to 7. You arrive at node 3 at `t = 5`.

Hence, the minimum time to reach node 3 is 5.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[1,0,1,3],[1,2,3,5]]

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:**

	- Since there is no outgoing edge from node 0, it is impossible to reach node 2. Hence, the output is -1.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
	- `0 <= edges.length <= 10^5`
	- `edges[i] == [u_i, v_i, start_i, end_i]`
	- `0 <= u_i, v_i <= n - 1`
	- `u_i != v_i`
	- `0 <= start_i <= end_i <= 10^9`

## Hints

1. Use the Dijkstra algorithm over states (node, time).
2. At node u with current time t, you can only use an edge [u, v, start, end] if t .
3. If t , wait until start, then traverse (arriving at start + 1).
