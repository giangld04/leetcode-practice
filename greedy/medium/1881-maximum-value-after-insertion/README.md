# 1881. Maximum Value after Insertion

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** String, Greedy
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-value-after-insertion/

## Description

You are given a very large integer `n`, represented as a string,​​​​​​ and an integer digit `x`. The digits in `n` and the digit `x` are in the **inclusive** range `[1, 9]`, and `n` may represent a negative number.

You want to **maximize **`n`**'s numerical value** by inserting `x` anywhere in the decimal representation of `n`​​​​​​. You **cannot** insert `x` to the left of the negative sign.

	- For example, if `n = 73` and `x = 6`, it would be best to insert it between `7` and `3`, making `n = 763`.
	- If `n = -55` and `x = 2`, it would be best to insert it before the first `5`, making `n = -255`.

Return *a string representing the **maximum** value of *`n`*​​​​​​ after the insertion*.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** n = "99", x = 9
**Output:** "999"
**Explanation:** The result is the same regardless of where you insert 9.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** n = "-13", x = 2
**Output:** "-123"
**Explanation:** You can make n one of {-213, -123, -132}, and the largest of those three is -123.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= x <= 9`
	- The digits in `n`​​​ are in the range `[1, 9]`.
	- `n` is a valid representation of an integer.
	- In the case of a negative `n`,​​​​​​ it will begin with `'-'`.

## Hints

1. Note that if the number is negative it's the same as positive but you look for the minimum instead.
2. In the case of maximum, if s[i] < x it's optimal that x is put before s[i].
3. In the case of minimum, if s[i] > x it's optimal that x is put before s[i].

## Test Cases
