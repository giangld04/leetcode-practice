# 3675. Minimum Operations to Transform String

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** String, Greedy
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-transform-string/

## Description

You are given a string `s` consisting only of lowercase English letters.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

	- 
Choose any character `c` in the string and replace **every** occurrence of `c` with the **next** lowercase letter in the English alphabet.

	

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to transform `s` into a string consisting of **only** `'a'` characters.

**Note: **Consider the alphabet as circular, thus `'a'` comes after `'z'`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "yz"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

	- Change `'y'` to `'z'` to get `"zz"`.
	- Change `'z'` to `'a'` to get `"aa"`.
	- Thus, the answer is 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "a"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

	- The string `"a"` only consists of `'a'`​​​​​​​ characters. Thus, the answer is 0.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^5`
	- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Hints

1. Each operation shifts every occurrence of a chosen character forward by one in the alphabet (with wrap-around).
2. For any character c, the number of moves required to turn it into 'a' is (26 - (ord(c) - ord('a'))) % 26.
3. You can plan operations so characters that need more shifts are advanced first and cause merges that don't increase the total number of moves; therefore the minimum number of moves equals the maximum, over characters appearing in s, of (26 - (ord(c) - ord('a'))) % 26.

## Test Cases

```
"yz"

"a"

```
