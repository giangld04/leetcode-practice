# 2429. Minimize XOR

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Greedy, Bit Manipulation
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-xor/

## Description

Given two positive integers `num1` and `num2`, find the positive integer `x` such that:

	- `x` has the same number of set bits as `num2`, and
	- The value `x XOR num1` is **minimal**.

Note that `XOR` is the bitwise XOR operation.

Return *the integer *`x`. The test cases are generated such that `x` is **uniquely determined**.

The number of **set bits** of an integer is the number of `1`'s in its binary representation.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** num1 = 3, num2 = 5
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
The binary representations of num1 and num2 are 0011 and 0101, respectively.
The integer **3** has the same number of set bits as num2, and the value `3 XOR 3 = 0` is minimal.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** num1 = 1, num2 = 12
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
The binary representations of num1 and num2 are 0001 and 1100, respectively.
The integer **3** has the same number of set bits as num2, and the value `3 XOR 1 = 2` is minimal.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= num1, num2 <= 10^9`

## Hints

1. To arrive at a small xor, try to turn off some bits from num1
2. If there are still left bits to set, try to set them from the least significant bit
