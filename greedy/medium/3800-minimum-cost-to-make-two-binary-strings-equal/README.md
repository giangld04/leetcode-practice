# 3800. Minimum Cost to Make Two Binary Strings Equal

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** String, Greedy
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-make-two-binary-strings-equal/

## Description

You are given two binary strings `s` and `t`, both of length `n`, and three **positive** integers `flipCost`, `swapCost`, and `crossCost`.

You are allowed to apply the following operations any number of times (in any order) to the strings `s` and `t`:

	- Choose any index `i` and flip `s[i]` or `t[i]` (change `'0'` to `'1'` or `'1'` to `'0'`). The cost of this operation is `flipCost`.
	- Choose two **distinct** indices `i` and `j`, and swap either `s[i]` and `s[j]` or `t[i]` and `t[j]`. The cost of this operation is `swapCost`.
	- Choose an index `i` and swap `s[i]` with `t[i]`. The cost of this operation is `crossCost`.

Return an integer denoting the **minimum** total cost needed to make the strings `s` and `t` equal.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "01000", t = "10111", flipCost = 10, swapCost = 2, crossCost = 2

**Output:** 16

**Explanation:**

We can perform the following operations:

	- Swap `s[0]` and `s[1]` (`swapCost = 2`). After this operation, `s = "10000"` and `t = "10111"`.
	- Cross swap `s[2]` and `t[2]` (`crossCost = 2`). After this operation, `s = "10100"` and `t = "10011"`.
	- Swap `s[2]` and `s[3]` (`swapCost = 2`). After this operation, `s = "10010"` and `t = "10011"`.
	- Flip `s[4]` (`flipCost = 10`). After this operation, `s = t = "10011"`.

The total cost is `2 + 2 + 2 + 10 = 16`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "001", t = "110", flipCost = 2, swapCost = 100, crossCost = 100

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

Flipping all the bits of `s` makes the strings equal, and the total cost is `3 * flipCost = 3 * 2 = 6`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "1010", t = "1010", flipCost = 5, swapCost = 5, crossCost = 5

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

The strings are already equal, so no operations are required.

**Constraints:**

	- `n == s.length == t.length`
	- `1 <= n <= 10^5`​​​​​​​
	- `1 <= flipCost, swapCost, crossCost <= 10^9`
	- `s` and `t` consist only of the characters `'0'` and `'1'`.

## Hints

1. Count mismatches: a = #(s = '0' , t = '1' ) , b = #(s = '1' , t = '0').
2. Pair opposite mismatches: p = min( a , b). Fix each pair with cost min(swapCost , 2 * flipCost).
3. Update counts: a = a - p, b = b - p. Let r = abs( a - b).
4. Fix remaining mismatches in pairs: each pair costs min(crossCost + swapCost , 2 * flipCost).
5. If one mismatch remains (r % 2 == 1), pay flipCost.
6. Sum all costs for the answer.
