# 2224. Minimum Number of Operations to Convert Time

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Tags:** String, Greedy
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-convert-time/

## Description

You are given two strings `current` and `correct` representing two **24-hour times**.

24-hour times are formatted as `"HH:MM"`, where `HH` is between `00` and `23`, and `MM` is between `00` and `59`. The earliest 24-hour time is `00:00`, and the latest is `23:59`.

In one operation you can increase the time `current` by `1`, `5`, `15`, or `60` minutes. You can perform this operation **any** number of times.

Return *the **minimum number of operations** needed to convert *`current`* to *`correct`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** current = "02:30", correct = "04:35"
**Output:** 3
Explanation:
We can convert current to correct in 3 operations as follows:
- Add 60 minutes to current. current becomes "03:30".
- Add 60 minutes to current. current becomes "04:30".
- Add 5 minutes to current. current becomes "04:35".
It can be proven that it is not possible to convert current to correct in fewer than 3 operations.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** current = "11:00", correct = "11:01"
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** We only have to add one minute to current, so the minimum number of operations needed is 1.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `current` and `correct` are in the format `"HH:MM"`
	- `current <= correct`

## Hints

1. Convert the times to minutes.
2. Use the operation with the biggest value possible at each step.

## Test Cases

```
"02:30"
"04:35"

"11:00"
"11:01"

```
