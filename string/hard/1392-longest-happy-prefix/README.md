**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** String, Rolling Hash, String Matching, Hash Function
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-happy-prefix/

## Description

A string is called a **happy prefix** if is a **non-empty** prefix which is also a suffix (excluding itself).

Given a string `s`, return *the **longest happy prefix** of* `s`. Return an empty string `""` if no such prefix exists.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** s = "level"
**Output:** "l"
**Explanation:** s contains 4 prefix excluding itself ("l", "le", "lev", "leve"), and suffix ("l", "el", "vel", "evel"). The largest prefix which is also suffix is given by "l".
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** s = "ababab"
**Output:** "abab"
**Explanation:** "abab" is the largest prefix which is also suffix. They can overlap in the original string.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
	- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

## Hints

1. Use Longest Prefix Suffix (KMP-table) or String Hashing.

## Test Cases

```
"level"
---
"ababab"
---
```
