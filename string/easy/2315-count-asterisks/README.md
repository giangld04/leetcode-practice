# 2315. Count Asterisks

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Tags:** String
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-asterisks/

## Description

You are given a string `s`, where every **two** consecutive vertical bars `'|'` are grouped into a **pair**. In other words, the 1^st and 2^nd `'|'` make a pair, the 3^rd and 4^th `'|'` make a pair, and so forth.

Return *the number of *`'*'`* in *`s`*, **excluding** the *`'*'`* between each pair of *`'|'`.

**Note** that each `'|'` will belong to **exactly** one pair.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** s = "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The considered characters are underlined: "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|".
The characters between the first and second '|' are excluded from the answer.
Also, the characters between the third and fourth '|' are excluded from the answer.
There are 2 asterisks considered. Therefore, we return 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** s = "iamprogrammer"
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this example, there are no asterisks in s. Therefore, we return 0.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** s = "yo|uar|e**|b|e***au|tifu|l"
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The considered characters are underlined: "yo|uar|e**|b|e***au|tifu|l". There are 5 asterisks considered. Therefore, we return 5.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
	- `s` consists of lowercase English letters, vertical bars `'|'`, and asterisks `'*'`.
	- `s` contains an **even** number of vertical bars `'|'`.

## Hints

1. Iterate through each character, while maintaining whether we are currently between a pair of ‘|’ or not.
2. If we are not in between a pair of ‘|’ and there is a ‘*’, increment the answer by 1.

## Test Cases

```
"l|*e*et|c**o|*de|"

"iamprogrammer"
---
"yo|uar|e**|b|e***au|tifu|l"
