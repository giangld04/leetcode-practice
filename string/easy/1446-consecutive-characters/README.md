**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-characters/

## Description

The **power** of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

Given a string `s`, return *the **power** of* `s`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** s = "leetcode"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"

```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 500`
	- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

## Hints

1. Keep an array power where power[i] is the maximum power of the i-th character.
2. The answer is max(power[i]).
