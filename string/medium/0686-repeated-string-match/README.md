# 686. Repeated String Match

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** String, String Matching
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-string-match/

## Description

Given two strings `a` and `b`, return *the minimum number of times you should repeat string *`a`* so that string* `b` *is a substring of it*. If it is impossible for `b`​​​​​​ to be a substring of `a` after repeating it, return `-1`.

**Notice:** string `"abc"` repeated 0 times is `""`, repeated 1 time is `"abc"` and repeated 2 times is `"abcabc"`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** a = "abcd", b = "cdabcdab"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We return 3 because by repeating a three times "ab**cdabcdab**cd", b is a substring of it.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** a = "a", b = "aa"
**Output:** 2
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^4`
	- `a` and `b` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Test Cases

```
"abcd"
"cdabcdab"
---
"a"
"aa"
---
```
