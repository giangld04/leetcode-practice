# 1419. Minimum Number of Frogs Croaking

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** String, Counting
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-frogs-croaking/

## Description

You are given the string `croakOfFrogs`, which represents a combination of the string `"croak"` from different frogs, that is, multiple frogs can croak at the same time, so multiple `"croak"` are mixed.

*Return the minimum number of *different* frogs to finish all the croaks in the given string.*

A valid `"croak"` means a frog is printing five letters `'c'`, `'r'`, `'o'`, `'a'`, and `'k'` **sequentially**. The frogs have to print all five letters to finish a croak. If the given string is not a combination of a valid `"croak"` return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** croakOfFrogs = "croakcroak"
**Output:** 1 
**Explanation:** One frog yelling "croak**"** twice.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** croakOfFrogs = "crcoakroak"
**Output:** 2 
**Explanation:** The minimum number of frogs is two. 
The first frog could yell "**cr**c**oak**roak".
The second frog could yell later "cr**c**oak**roak**".
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** croakOfFrogs = "croakcrook"
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** The given string is an invalid combination of "croak**"** from different frogs.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= croakOfFrogs.length <= 10^5`
	- `croakOfFrogs` is either `'c'`, `'r'`, `'o'`, `'a'`, or `'k'`.

## Hints

1. keep the frequency of all characters from "croak" using a hashmap.
2. For each character in the given string, greedily match it to a possible "croak".

## Test Cases

```
"croakcroak"
---
"crcoakroak"
---
"croakcrook"
