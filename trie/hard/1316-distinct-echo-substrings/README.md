# 1316. Distinct Echo Substrings

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** String, Trie, Rolling Hash, Hash Function
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-echo-substrings/

## Description

Return the number of **distinct** non-empty substrings of `text` that can be written as the concatenation of some string with itself (i.e. it can be written as `a + a` where `a` is some string).

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** text = "abcabcabc"
**Output:** 3
Explanation: The 3 substrings are "abcabc", "bcabca" and "cabcab".
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** text = "leetcodeleetcode"
**Output:** 2
Explanation: The 2 substrings are "ee" and "leetcodeleetcode".
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= text.length <= 2000`
	- `text` has only lowercase English letters.

## Hints

1. Given a substring of the text, how to check if it can be written as the concatenation of a string with itself ?
2. We can do that in linear time, a faster way is to use hashing.
3. Try all substrings and use hashing to check them.

## Test Cases

```
"abcabcabc"

"leetcodeleetcode"
