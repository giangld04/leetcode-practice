# 3928. Minimum Cost to Buy Apples II

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** Array, Graph Theory, Heap (Priority Queue), Shortest Path
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-buy-apples-ii/

## Description

You are given an integer `n` and an integer array `prices` of length `n`, where `prices[i]` is the price of apples at shop `i`.

You are also given a 2D integer array `roads`, where `roads[i] = [u_i, v_i, cost_i, tax_i]` represents a **bidirectional** road:

	- `u_i` and `v_i` are the shops connected by the road.
	- `cost_i` is the cost to travel the road **without** carrying apples.
	- `tax_i` is the multiplier applied to `cost_i` when traveling **with** apples.

For each shop `i`, you can either:

	- Buy apples locally at shop `i` for `prices[i]`.
	- Travel **empty** to any shop `j` using **any** number of roads, buy apples for `prices[j]`, and return to shop `i` while carrying apples, paying `cost * tax` on each road used for the return trip.

The forward path, where you travel empty, and the return path may be **different**.

Return an integer array `ans` of length `n`, where `ans[i]` is the **minimum** total cost to buy apples starting from shop `i`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2, prices = [8,3], roads = [[0,1,1,2]]

**Output:** [6,3]

**Explanation:**

	
		
			Shop i
			prices[i]
			Shop j
			`prices[j]`
			cost_i
			tax_i
			Travel cost
			Return cost
			Total
			Minimum

			`1 * 2 = 2`

			`min(8, 6) = 6`

			2
			1
			`1 * 2 = 2`
			`1 + 2 + 8 = 11`
			`min(3, 11) = 3`
		
	

Thus, the answer is `[6, 3]`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, prices = [9,4,6], roads = [[0,1,1,3],[1,2,4,2]]

**Output:** [8,4,6]

			`4 + 8 + 4 = 16`
			`min(6, 16) = 6`
		
	

Thus, the answer is `[8, 4, 6]`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 3, prices = [10,11,1], roads = [[0,2,1,3],[1,2,3,4],[0,1,5,2]]

**Output:** [5,11,1]

**Explanation:**

**​​​​​​​​​​​​​​**

	
		
			Shop i
			prices[i]
			Shop j
			`prices[j]`
			cost_i
			tax_i
			Travel cost
			Return cost
			Total
			Minimum

			1
			`1 * 3 = 3`
			`1 + 3 + 1 = 5`
			`min(10, 5) = 5`
		
		
			1
			11
			2
			1
			3
			4
			3
			`3 * 4 = 12`
			`3 + 12 + 1 = 16`

			3

			`1 * 3 = 3`
			`1 + 3 + 10 = 14`
			`min(1, 14) = 1`
		
	

Thus, the answer is `[5, 11, 1]`.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 1000`
	- `prices.length == n`
	- `1 <= prices[i] <= 10^9`
	- `0 <= roads.length <= min(n × (n - 1) / 2, 2000)`
	- `roads[i] = [u_i, v_i, cost_i, tax_i]`
	- `0 <= u_i, v_i <= n - 1`
	- `u_i != v_i`
	- `1 <= cost_i <= 10^9`
	- `​​​​​​​1 <= tax_​​​​​​​i <= 100`​​​​​​​
	- There are no **repeated** edges.
