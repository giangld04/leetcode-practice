## Description

You are given an array `nums` of `n` positive integers and an integer `k`.

Initially, you start with a score of `1`. You have to maximize your score by applying the following operation at most `k` times:

	- Choose any **non-empty** subarray `nums[l, ..., r]` that you haven't chosen previously.
	- Choose an element `x` of `nums[l, ..., r]` with the highest **prime score**. If multiple such elements exist, choose the one with the smallest index.
	- Multiply your score by `x`.

Here, `nums[l, ..., r]` denotes the subarray of `nums` starting at index `l` and ending at the index `r`, both ends being inclusive.

The **prime score** of an integer `x` is equal to the number of distinct prime factors of `x`. For example, the prime score of `300` is `3` since `300 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 * 5`.

Return *the **maximum possible score** after applying at most *`k`* operations*.

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** nums = [8,3,9,3,8], k = 2
**Output:** 81
**Explanation:** To get a score of 81, we can apply the following operations:
- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 2]. nums[2] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 1 * 9 = 9.
- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 3]. Both nums[2] and nums[3] have a prime score of 1, but nums[2] has the smaller index. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 9 * 9 = 81.
It can be proven that 81 is the highest score one can obtain.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** nums = [19,12,14,6,10,18], k = 3
**Output:** 4788
**Explanation:** To get a score of 4788, we can apply the following operations: 
- Choose subarray nums[0, ..., 0]. nums[0] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[0]. The score becomes 1 * 19 = 19.
- Choose subarray nums[5, ..., 5]. nums[5] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[5]. The score becomes 19 * 18 = 342.
- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 3]. Both nums[2] and nums[3] have a prime score of 2, but nums[2] has the smaller index. Hence, we multipy the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 342 * 14 = 4788.
It can be proven that 4788 is the highest score one can obtain.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length == n <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= k <= min(n * (n + 1) / 2, 10^9)`

## Hints

1. Calculate nums[i]'s prime score s[i] by factoring in O(sqrt(nums[i])) time.
2. For each nums[i], find the nearest index left[i] on the left (if any) such that s[left[i]] >= s[i]. if none is found, set left[i] to -1. Similarly, find the nearest index right[i] on the right (if any) such that s[right[i]] > s[i]. If none is found, set right[i] to n.
3. Use a monotonic stack to compute right[i] and left[i].
4. For each index i, if left[i] + 1 , then s[i] is the maximum value in the range [l, r]. For this particular i, there are ranges[i] = (i - left[i]) * (right[i] - i) ranges where index i will be chosen.
5. Loop over all elements of nums by non-increasing prime score, each element will be chosen min(ranges[i], remainingK) times, where reaminingK denotes the number of remaining operations. Therefore, the score will be multiplied by s[i]^min(ranges[i],remainingK).
6. Use fast exponentiation to quickly calculate A^B mod C.
