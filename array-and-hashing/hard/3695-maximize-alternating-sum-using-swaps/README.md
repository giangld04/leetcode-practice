**Tags:** Array, Greedy, Union-Find, Sorting
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-alternating-sum-using-swaps/

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

You want to maximize the **alternating sum** of `nums`, which is defined as the value obtained by **adding** elements at even indices and **subtracting** elements at odd indices. That is, `nums[0] - nums[1] + nums[2] - nums[3]...`

You are also given a 2D integer array `swaps` where `swaps[i] = [p_i, q_i]`. For each pair `[p_i, q_i]` in `swaps`, you are allowed to swap the elements at indices `p_i` and `q_i`. These swaps can be performed any number of times and in any order.

Return the maximum possible **alternating sum** of `nums`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3], swaps = [[0,2],[1,2]]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

The maximum alternating sum is achieved when `nums` is `[2, 1, 3]` or `[3, 1, 2]`. As an example, you can obtain `nums = [2, 1, 3]` as follows.

	- Swap `nums[0]` and `nums[2]`. `nums` is now `[3, 2, 1]`.
	- Swap `nums[1]` and `nums[2]`. `nums` is now `[3, 1, 2]`.
	- Swap `nums[0]` and `nums[2]`. `nums` is now `[2, 1, 3]`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3], swaps = [[1,2]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The maximum alternating sum is achieved by not performing any swaps.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,1000000000,1,1000000000,1,1000000000], swaps = []

**Output:** -2999999997

**Explanation:**

Since we cannot perform any swaps, the maximum alternating sum is achieved by not performing any swaps.

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
	- `0 <= swaps.length <= 10^5`
	- `swaps[i] = [p_i, q_i]`
	- `0 <= p_i < q_i <= nums.length - 1`
	- `[p_i, q_i] != [p_j, q_j]`

## Hints

1. Build connected components using a DSU (disjoint-set union).
2. Let E be the count of even indices inside that component. In each component, place the largest E values on the component's even indices.
3. The component's contribution to the alternating sum is 2 * sumTopE - sumAll, where sumTopE is the sum of the largest E values and sumAll is the sum of all values in the component.
