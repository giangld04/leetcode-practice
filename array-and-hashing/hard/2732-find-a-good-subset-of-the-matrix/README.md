## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` binary matrix `grid`.

Let us call a **non-empty** subset of rows **good** if the sum of each column of the subset is at most half of the length of the subset.

More formally, if the length of the chosen subset of rows is `k`, then the sum of each column should be at most `floor(k / 2)`.

Return *an integer array that contains row indices of a good subset sorted in **ascending** order.*

If there are multiple good subsets, you can return any of them. If there are no good subsets, return an empty array.

A **subset** of rows of the matrix `grid` is any matrix that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none or all) rows from `grid`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** grid = [[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]]
**Output:** [0,1]
**Explanation:** We can choose the 0^th and 1^st rows to create a good subset of rows.
The length of the chosen subset is 2.
- The sum of the 0^th column is 0 + 0 = 0, which is at most half of the length of the subset.
- The sum of the 1^st column is 1 + 0 = 1, which is at most half of the length of the subset.
- The sum of the 2^nd column is 1 + 0 = 1, which is at most half of the length of the subset.
- The sum of the 3^rd column is 0 + 1 = 1, which is at most half of the length of the subset.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** grid = [[0]]
**Output:** [0]
**Explanation:** We can choose the 0^th row to create a good subset of rows.
The length of the chosen subset is 1.
- The sum of the 0^th column is 0, which is at most half of the length of the subset.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** grid = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]
**Output:** []
**Explanation:** It is impossible to choose any subset of rows to create a good subset.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `m == grid.length`
	- `n == grid[i].length`
	- `1 <= m <= 10^4`
	- `1 <= n <= 5`
	- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

## Hints

1. It can be proven, that if there exists a good subset of rows then there exists a good subset of rows with the size of either 1 or 2.
2. To check if there exists a good subset of rows of size 1, we check if there exists a row containing only zeros, if it does, we return its index as a good subset.
3. To check if there exists a good subset of rows of size 2, we iterate over two bit-masks, check if both are presented in the array and if they form a good subset, if they do, return their indices as a good subset.

## Test Cases

```
[[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]]
---
[[0]]
---
[[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]
---
```
