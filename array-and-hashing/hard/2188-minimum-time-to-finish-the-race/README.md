# 2188. Minimum Time to Finish the Race

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** Array, Dynamic Programming
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-finish-the-race/

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `tires` where `tires[i] = [f_i, r_i]` indicates that the `i^th` tire can finish its `x^th` successive lap in `f_i * r_i^(x-1)` seconds.

	- For example, if `f_i = 3` and `r_i = 2`, then the tire would finish its `1^st` lap in `3` seconds, its `2^nd` lap in `3 * 2 = 6` seconds, its `3^rd` lap in `3 * 2^2 = 12` seconds, etc.

You are also given an integer `changeTime` and an integer `numLaps`.

The race consists of `numLaps` laps and you may start the race with **any** tire. You have an **unlimited** supply of each tire and after every lap, you may **change** to any given tire (including the current tire type) if you wait `changeTime` seconds.

Return* the **minimum** time to finish the race.*

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** tires = [[2,3],[3,4]], changeTime = 5, numLaps = 4
**Output:** 21
**Explanation:** 
Lap 1: Start with tire 0 and finish the lap in 2 seconds.
Lap 2: Continue with tire 0 and finish the lap in 2 * 3 = 6 seconds.
Lap 3: Change tires to a new tire 0 for 5 seconds and then finish the lap in another 2 seconds.
Lap 4: Continue with tire 0 and finish the lap in 2 * 3 = 6 seconds.
Total time = 2 + 6 + 5 + 2 + 6 = 21 seconds.
The minimum time to complete the race is 21 seconds.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** tires = [[1,10],[2,2],[3,4]], changeTime = 6, numLaps = 5
**Output:** 25
**Explanation:** 
Lap 1: Start with tire 1 and finish the lap in 2 seconds.
Lap 2: Continue with tire 1 and finish the lap in 2 * 2 = 4 seconds.
Lap 3: Change tires to a new tire 1 for 6 seconds and then finish the lap in another 2 seconds.
Lap 4: Continue with tire 1 and finish the lap in 2 * 2 = 4 seconds.
Lap 5: Change tires to tire 0 for 6 seconds then finish the lap in another 1 second.
Total time = 2 + 4 + 6 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 1 = 25 seconds.
The minimum time to complete the race is 25 seconds.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= tires.length <= 10^5`
	- `tires[i].length == 2`
	- `1 <= f_i, changeTime <= 10^5`
	- `2 <= r_i <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= numLaps <= 1000`

## Hints

1. What is the maximum number of times we would want to go around the track without changing tires?
2. Can we precompute the minimum time to go around the track x times without changing tires?
3. Can we use dynamic programming to solve this efficiently using the precomputed values?
