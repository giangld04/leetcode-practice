**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-bitwise-and-after-increment-operations/

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `k` and `m`.

You may perform **at most** `k` operations. In one operation, you may choose any index `i` and **increase** `nums[i]` by 1.

Return an integer denoting the **maximum** possible **bitwise AND** of any **subset** of size `m` after performing up to `k` operations optimally.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [3,1,2], k = 8, m = 2

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

	- We need a subset of size `m = 2`. Choose indices `[0, 2]`.
	- Increase `nums[0] = 3` to 6 using 3 operations, and increase `nums[2] = 2` to 6 using 4 operations.
	- The total number of operations used is 7, which is not greater than `k = 8`.
	- The two chosen values become `[6, 6]`, and their bitwise AND is `6`, which is the maximum possible.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,8,4], k = 7, m = 3

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

	- We need a subset of size `m = 3`. Choose indices `[0, 1, 3]`.
	- Increase `nums[0] = 1` to 4 using 3 operations, increase `nums[1] = 2` to 4 using 2 operations, and keep `nums[3] = 4`.
	- The total number of operations used is 5, which is not greater than `k = 7`.
	- The three chosen values become `[4, 4, 4]`, and their bitwise AND is 4, which is the maximum possible.​​​​​​​

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,1], k = 3, m = 2

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

	- We need a subset of size `m = 2`. Choose indices `[0, 1]`.
	- Increase both values from 1 to 2 using 1 operation each.
	- The total number of operations used is 2, which is not greater than `k = 3`.
	- The two chosen values become `[2, 2]`, and their bitwise AND is 2, which is the maximum possible.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n == nums.length <= 5 * 10^4`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
	- `1 <= k <= 10^9`
	- `1 <= m <= n`

## Hints

1. Use a greedy bitwise approach.
2. Iterate bits from highest to lowest and try setting the current bit in a candidate res.
3. To test a candidate, for each num compute the minimal increments needed so that (num | candidate) == candidate; take the smallest m costs and check if their sum k.
4. If feasible, keep the bit in res and continue with accumulated bits.
