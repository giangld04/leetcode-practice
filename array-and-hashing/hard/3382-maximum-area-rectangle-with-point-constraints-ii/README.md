## Description

There are n points on an infinite plane. You are given two integer arrays `xCoord` and `yCoord` where `(xCoord[i], yCoord[i])` represents the coordinates of the `i^th` point.

Your task is to find the **maximum **area of a rectangle that:

	- Can be formed using **four** of these points as its corners.
	- Does **not** contain any other point inside or on its border.
	- Has its edges **parallel** to the axes.

Return the **maximum area** that you can obtain or -1 if no such rectangle is possible.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** xCoord = [1,1,3,3], yCoord = [1,3,1,3]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

****

We can make a rectangle with these 4 points as corners and there is no other point that lies inside or on the border. Hence, the maximum possible area would be 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** xCoord = [1,1,3,3,2], yCoord = [1,3,1,3,2]

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:**

****

There is only one rectangle possible is with points `[1,1], [1,3], [3,1]` and `[3,3]` but `[2,2]` will always lie inside it. Hence, returning -1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** xCoord = [1,1,3,3,1,3], yCoord = [1,3,1,3,2,2]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

****

The maximum area rectangle is formed by the points `[1,3], [1,2], [3,2], [3,3]`, which has an area of 2. Additionally, the points `[1,1], [1,2], [3,1], [3,2]` also form a valid rectangle with the same area.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= xCoord.length == yCoord.length <= 2 * 10^5`
	- `0 <= xCoord[i], yCoord[i] <= 8 * 10^7`
	- All the given points are **unique**.

## Hints

1. Process the points by sorting them based on their x-coordinates.
2. For each x-coordinate, sort the corresponding points by y and select two consecutive points y1 and y2 (y1 < y2).
3. Identify the closest x-coordinate (greater than the current x) where some y-coordinates lie in [y1, y2].
4. Use a segment tree to efficiently locate the nearest x-coordinate.
5. Check if the points form a valid rectangle. How?
