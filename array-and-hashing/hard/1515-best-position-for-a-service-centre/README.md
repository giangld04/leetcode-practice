# 1515. Best Position for a Service Centre

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** Array, Math, Geometry, Randomized

## Description

A delivery company wants to build a new service center in a new city. The company knows the positions of all the customers in this city on a 2D-Map and wants to build the new center in a position such that **the sum of the euclidean distances to all customers is minimum**.

Given an array `positions` where `positions[i] = [x_i, y_i]` is the position of the `ith` customer on the map, return *the minimum sum of the euclidean distances* to all customers.

In other words, you need to choose the position of the service center `[x_centre, y_centre]` such that the following formula is minimized:

Answers within `10^-5` of the actual value will be accepted.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** positions = [[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1]]
**Output:** 4.00000
**Explanation:** As shown, you can see that choosing [x_centre, y_centre] = [1, 1] will make the distance to each customer = 1, the sum of all distances is 4 which is the minimum possible we can achieve.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** positions = [[1,1],[3,3]]
**Output:** 2.82843
**Explanation:** The minimum possible sum of distances = sqrt(2) + sqrt(2) = 2.82843
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= positions.length <= 50`
	- `positions[i].length == 2`
	- `0 <= x_i, y_i <= 100`

## Hints

1. The problem can be reworded as, giving a set of points on a 2d-plane, return the geometric median.
2. Loop over each triplet of points (positions[i], positions[j], positions[k]) where i < j < k, get the centre of the circle which goes throw the 3 points, check if all other points lie in this circle.

## Test Cases
