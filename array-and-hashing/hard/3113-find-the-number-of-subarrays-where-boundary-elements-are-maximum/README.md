## Description

You are given an array of **positive** integers `nums`.

Return the number of subarrays of `nums`, where the **first** and the **last** elements of the subarray are *equal* to the **largest** element in the subarray.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,4,3,3,2]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

There are 6 subarrays which have the first and the last elements equal to the largest element of the subarray:

	- subarray `[**1**,4,3,3,2]`, with its largest element 1. The first element is 1 and the last element is also 1.
	- subarray `[1,**4**,3,3,2]`, with its largest element 4. The first element is 4 and the last element is also 4.
	- subarray `[1,4,**3**,3,2]`, with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
	- subarray `[1,4,3,**3**,2]`, with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
	- subarray `[1,4,3,3,**2**]`, with its largest element 2. The first element is 2 and the last element is also 2.
	- subarray `[1,4,**3,3**,2]`, with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.

Hence, we return 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,3,3]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

There are 6 subarrays which have the first and the last elements equal to the largest element of the subarray:

	- subarray `[**3**,3,3]`, with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
	- subarray `[3,**3**,3]`, with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
	- subarray `[3,3,**3**]`, with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
	- subarray `[**3,3**,3]`, with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
	- subarray `[3,**3,3**]`, with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
	- subarray `[**3,3,3**]`, with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.

Hence, we return 6.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

There is a single subarray of `nums` which is `[**1**]`, with its largest element 1. The first element is 1 and the last element is also 1.

Hence, we return 1.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Hints

1. For each element nums[i], we can count the number of valid subarrays ending with it.
2. For each index i, find the nearest index j on its left (j  such that nums[j] . This can be done via a monotonic stack.
3. For each index i, find the number of indices k in the window [j + 1, i] such that nums[k] == nums[i], this is the number of the valid subarrays ending with nums[i]. This can be done by sliding window.
4. Sum the answer of all the indices i to get the final result.
5. Is it possible to use DSU as an alternate solution?
