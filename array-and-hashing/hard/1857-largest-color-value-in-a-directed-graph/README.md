## Description

There is a **directed graph** of `n` colored nodes and `m` edges. The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given a string `colors` where `colors[i]` is a lowercase English letter representing the **color** of the `i^th` node in this graph (**0-indexed**). You are also given a 2D array `edges` where `edges[j] = [a_j, b_j]` indicates that there is a **directed edge** from node `a_j` to node `b_j`.

A valid **path** in the graph is a sequence of nodes `x_1 -> x_2 -> x_3 -> ... -> x_k` such that there is a directed edge from `x_i` to `x_i+1` for every `1 <= i < k`. The **color value** of the path is the number of nodes that are colored the **most frequently** occurring color along that path.

Return *the **largest color value** of any valid path in the given graph, or *`-1`* if the graph contains a cycle*.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** colors = "abaca", edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The path 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 contains 3 nodes that are colored `"a" (red in the above image)`.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** colors = "a", edges = [[0,0]]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There is a cycle from 0 to 0.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `n == colors.length`
	- `m == edges.length`
	- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
	- `0 <= m <= 10^5`
	- `colors` consists of lowercase English letters.
	- `0 <= a_j, b_j < n`

## Hints

1. Use topological sort.
2. let dp[u][c] := the maximum count of vertices with color c of any path starting from vertex u. (by JerryJin2905)

## Test Cases

```
"abaca"
[[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
---
"a"
[[0,0]]
---
```
