**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-ways-to-choose-coprime-integers-from-rows/

## Description

You are given a `m x n` matrix `mat` of positive integers.

Return an integer denoting the number of ways to choose **exactly one** integer from each row of `mat` such that the **greatest common divisor** of all chosen integers is 1.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** mat = [[1,2],[3,4]]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

	
		
			Chosen integer in the first row
			Chosen integer in the second row
			Greatest common divisor of chosen integers
		
		
			1
			3
			1
		
		
			1
			4
			1
		
		
			2
			3
			1
		
		
			2
			4
			2
		
	

3 of these combinations have a greatest common divisor of 1. Therefore, the answer is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** mat = [[2,2],[2,2]]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

Every combination has a greatest common divisor of 2. Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= m == mat.length <= 150`
	- `1 <= n == mat[i].length <= 150`
	- `1 <= mat[i][j] <= 150`

## Hints

1. Use dynamic programming.
2. Use dp[row][g], where row is the current row and g is the current gcd value.
3. Initialize the first row: for each value v in row 0 do dp[0][v] += 1.
4. For a row i, use the values from the previous row i - 1 to build the values: for each previous gcd g and each value v in row i.
5. The final answer is dp[n-1][1] (number of ways with gcd 1).

## Test Cases

[[1,2],[3,4]]
