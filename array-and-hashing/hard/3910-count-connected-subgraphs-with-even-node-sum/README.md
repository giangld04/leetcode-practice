## Description

You are given an undirected graph with `n` nodes labeled from 0 to `n - 1`. Node `i` has a **value** of `nums[i]`, which is either 0 or 1. The edges of the graph are given by a 2D array `edges` where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` represents an edge between node `u_i` and node `v_i`.

For a **non-empty subset** `s` of nodes in the graph, we consider the **induced subgraph** of `s` generated as follows:

	- We keep only the nodes in `s`.
	- We keep only the edges whose two endpoints are both in `s`.

Return an integer representing the number of **non-empty** subsets `s` of nodes in the graph such that:

	- The **induced subgraph** of `s` is **connected**.
	- The **sum** of node **values** in `s` is **even**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,0,1], edges = [[0,1],[1,2]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

	
		
			`s`
			connected?
			sum of node values
			counted?
		
	
	
		
			`[0]`
			Yes
			1
			No
		
		
			`[1]`
			Yes
			0
			Yes
		
		
			`[2]`
			Yes
			1
			No
		
		
			`[0,1]`
			Yes
			1
			No
		
		
			`[0,2]`
			No, node 0 and node 2 are disconnected.
			2
			No
		
		
			`[1,2]`
			Yes
			1
			No
		
		
			`[0,1,2]`
			Yes
			2
			Yes
		
	

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1], edges = []

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

	
		
			`s`
			connected?
			sum of node values
			counted?
		
	
	
		
			`[0]`
			Yes
			1
			No
		
	

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n == nums.length <= 13`
	- `nums[i]` is 0 or 1.
	- `0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
	- `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]`
	- `0 <= u_i < v_i < n`
	- All edges are **distinct**.

## Hints

1. Enumerate all subsets with bitmasks
2. For each subset, check whether the induced subgraph is connected using DFS or BFS
3. Keep track of the parity of the sum of nums in the subset
4. Count the subset only if it is connected and the sum is even
5. Since n , a brute-force bitmask solution is feasible

## Test Cases

```
[1,0,1]
[[0,1],[1,2]]

[1]
[]

```
