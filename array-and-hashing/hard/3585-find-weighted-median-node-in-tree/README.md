**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-weighted-median-node-in-tree/

## Description

You are given an integer `n` and an **undirected, weighted** tree rooted at node 0 with `n` nodes numbered from 0 to `n - 1`. This is represented by a 2D array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, w_i]` indicates an edge from node `u_i` to `v_i` with weight `w_i`.

The **weighted median node** is defined as the **first** node `x` on the path from `u_i` to `v_i` such that the sum of edge weights from `u_i` to `x` is **greater than or equal to half** of the total path weight.

You are given a 2D integer array `queries`. For each `queries[j] = [u_j, v_j]`, determine the weighted median node along the path from `u_j` to `v_j`.

Return an array `ans`, where `ans[j]` is the node index of the weighted median for `queries[j]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2, edges = [[0,1,7]], queries = [[1,0],[0,1]]

**Output:** [0,1]

			`[1, 2]`
			`1 → 0 → 2`
			`[2, 4]`
			6
			3
			Sum from `1 → 0 = 2 < 3`.

			Sum from `1 → 2 = 2 + 4 = 6 >= 3`, median is node 2.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 5, edges = [[0,1,2],[0,2,5],[1,3,1],[2,4,3]], queries = [[3,4],[1,2]]

			`[3, 4]`
			`3 → 1 → 0 → 2 → 4`
			`[1, 2, 5, 3]`
			11
			5.5
			Sum from `3 → 1 = 1 < 5.5`.

			Sum from `3 → 0 = 1 + 2 = 3 < 5.5`.

			Sum from `3 → 2 = 1 + 2 + 5 = 8 >= 5.5`, median is node 2.
			2
		
		
			`[1, 2]`
			`1 → 0 → 2`
			`[2, 5]`
			7
			3.5
			
			
Sum from `1 → 0 = 2 < 3.5`.

			Sum from `1 → 2 = 2 + 5 = 7 >= 3.5`, median is node 2.

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
	- `edges.length == n - 1`
	- `edges[i] == [u_i, v_i, w_i]`
	- `0 <= u_i, v_i < n`
	- `1 <= w_i <= 10^9`
	- `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
	- `queries[j] == [u_j, v_j]`
	- `0 <= u_j, v_j < n`
	- The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.

## Hints

1. Use binary lifting and lowest common ancestor.
2. Let the query nodes be u and v, with lowest common ancestor l and total path weight tot.
3. If the median lies on the path from u up to l: find the first node where 2 * sum >= tot (equivalently, the last where 2 * sum  and move one node above).
4. Otherwise, it lies on the path from v up to l: use the same 2 * sum >= tot criterion as you climb.
5. In both cases, binary lifting with sparse tables lets you jump by powers of two while tracking cumulative weights to locate the weighted median in O(log n)
