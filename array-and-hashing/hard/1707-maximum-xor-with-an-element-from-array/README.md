# 1707. Maximum XOR With an Element From Array

**Difficulty:** Hard

## Description

You are given an array `nums` consisting of non-negative integers. You are also given a `queries` array, where `queries[i] = [x_i, m_i]`.

The answer to the `i^th` query is the maximum bitwise `XOR` value of `x_i` and any element of `nums` that does not exceed `m_i`. In other words, the answer is `max(nums[j] XOR x_i)` for all `j` such that `nums[j] <= m_i`. If all elements in `nums` are larger than `m_i`, then the answer is `-1`.

Return *an integer array *`answer`* where *`answer.length == queries.length`* and *`answer[i]`* is the answer to the *`i^th`* query.*

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** nums = [0,1,2,3,4], queries = [[3,1],[1,3],[5,6]]
**Output:** [3,3,7]
**Explanation:**
1) 0 and 1 are the only two integers not greater than 1. 0 XOR 3 = 3 and 1 XOR 3 = 2. The larger of the two is 3.
2) 1 XOR 2 = 3.
3) 5 XOR 2 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** nums = [5,2,4,6,6,3], queries = [[12,4],[8,1],[6,3]]
**Output:** [15,-1,5]
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length, queries.length <= 10^5`
	- `queries[i].length == 2`
	- `0 <= nums[j], x_i, m_i <= 10^9`

## Hints

1. In problems involving bitwise operations, we often think on the bits level. In this problem, we can think that to maximize the result of an xor operation, we need to maximize the most significant bit, then the next one, and so on.
2. If there's some number in the array that is less than m and whose the most significant bit is different than that of x, then xoring with this number maximizes the most significant bit, so I know this bit in the answer is 1.
3. To check the existence of such numbers and narrow your scope for further bits based on your choice, you can use trie.
4. You can sort the array and the queries, and maintain the trie such that in each query the trie consists exactly of the valid elements.

## Test Cases

[0,1,2,3,4]
[[3,1],[1,3],[5,6]]
