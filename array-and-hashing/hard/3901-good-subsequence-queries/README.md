# 3901. Good Subsequence Queries

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** Array, Math, Segment Tree, Number Theory
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/good-subsequence-queries/

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `p`.

A **non-empty subsequence** of `nums` is called **good** if:

	- Its length is **strictly less** than `n`.
	- The **greatest common divisor (GCD)** of its elements is **exactly** `p`.

You are also given a 2D integer array `queries` of length `q`, where each `queries[i] = [ind_i, val_i]` indicates that you should update `nums[ind_i]` to `val_i`.

After each query, determine whether there exists **any good subsequence** in the current array.

Return the **number** of queries for which a **good subsequence** exists.

The term `gcd(a, b)` denotes the **greatest common divisor** of `a` and `b`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [4,8,12,16], p = 2, queries = [[0,3],[2,6]]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

	
		
			i
			`[ind_i, val_i]`
			Operation
			Updated `nums`
			Any good Subsequence
		
	
	
		
			0
			`[0, 3]`
			Update `nums[0]` to `3`
			`[3, 8, 12, 16]`
			No, as no subsequence has GCD exactly `p = 2`
		
		
			1
			`[2, 6]`
			Update `nums[2]` to `6`
			`[3, 8, 6, 16]`
			Yes, subsequence `[8, 6]` has GCD exactly `p = 2`
		
	

Thus, the answer is 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [4,5,7,8], p = 3, queries = [[0,6],[1,9],[2,3]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

	
		
			i
			`[ind_i, val_i]`
			Operation
			Updated `nums`
			Any good Subsequence
		
	
	
		
			0
			`[0, 6]`
			Update `nums[0]` to `6`
			`[6, 5, 7, 8]`
			No, as no subsequence has GCD exactly `p = 3`
		
		
			1
			`[1, 9]`
			Update `nums[1]` to `9`
			`[6, 9, 7, 8]`
			Yes, subsequence `[6, 9]` has GCD exactly `p = 3`
		
		
			2
			`[2, 3]`
			Update `nums[2]` to `3`
			`[6, 9, 3, 8]`
			Yes, subsequence `[6, 9, 3]` has GCD exactly `p = 3`
		
	

Thus, the answer is 2.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [5,7,9], p = 2, queries = [[1,4],[2,8]]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

	
		
			i
			`[ind_i, val_i]`
			Operation
			Updated `nums`
			Any good Subsequence
		
	
	
		
			0
			`[1, 4]`
			Update `nums[1]` to `4`
			`[5, 4, 9]`
			No, as no subsequence has GCD exactly `p = 2`
		
		
			1
			`[2, 8]`
			Update `nums[2]` to `8`
			`[5, 4, 8]`
			No, as no subsequence has GCD exactly `p = 2`
		
	

Thus, the answer is 0.

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= n == nums.length <= 5 * 10^4`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 10^4`
	- `1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 10^4`
	- `queries[i] = [ind_i, val_i]`
	- `1 <= val_i, p <= 5 * 10^4`
	- `0 <= ind_i <= n - 1`

## Hints

1. Reduce the problem to only elements divisible by p. Scale them down by /p and reason about primes on the reduced array.
2. A subsequence has GCD = p exactly when, after division, the chosen elements do not all share any common prime factor.
3. Track, for each prime factor, how many active indices contain it. If any prime covers all active elements, the answer is false.
4. Check that there is an index whose prime factors do not cover all active elements (so a subsequence of length n can have GCD = p).
