# 2302. Count Subarrays With Score Less Than K

## Description

The **score** of an array is defined as the **product** of its sum and its length.

	- For example, the score of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is `(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) * 5 = 75`.

Given a positive integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return *the **number of non-empty subarrays** of* `nums` *whose score is **strictly less** than* `k`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** nums = [2,1,4,3,5], k = 10
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:**
The 6 subarrays having scores less than 10 are:
- [2] with score 2 * 1 = 2.
- [1] with score 1 * 1 = 1.
- [4] with score 4 * 1 = 4.
- [3] with score 3 * 1 = 3. 
- [5] with score 5 * 1 = 5.
- [2,1] with score (2 + 1) * 2 = 6.
Note that subarrays such as [1,4] and [4,3,5] are not considered because their scores are 10 and 36 respectively, while we need scores strictly less than 10.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** nums = [1,1,1], k = 5
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:**
Every subarray except [1,1,1] has a score less than 5.
[1,1,1] has a score (1 + 1 + 1) * 3 = 9, which is greater than 5.
Thus, there are 5 subarrays having scores less than 5.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= k <= 10^15`

## Hints

1. If we add an element to a list of elements, how will the score change?
2. How can we use this to determine the number of subarrays with score less than k in a given range?
3. How can we use “Two Pointers” to generalize the solution, and thus count all possible subarrays?

## Test Cases

```
