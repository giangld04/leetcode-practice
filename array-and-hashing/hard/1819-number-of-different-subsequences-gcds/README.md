**Difficulty:** Hard

**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-different-subsequences-gcds/

## Description

You are given an array `nums` that consists of positive integers.

The **GCD** of a sequence of numbers is defined as the greatest integer that divides **all** the numbers in the sequence evenly.

	- For example, the GCD of the sequence `[4,6,16]` is `2`.

A **subsequence** of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.

	- For example, `[2,5,10]` is a subsequence of `[1,2,1,**2**,4,1,**5**,**10**]`.

Return *the **number** of **different** GCDs among all **non-empty** subsequences of* `nums`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** nums = [6,10,3]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The figure shows all the non-empty subsequences and their GCDs.
The different GCDs are 6, 10, 3, 2, and 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** nums = [5,15,40,5,6]
**Output:** 7
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 2 * 10^5`

## Hints

1. Think of how to check if a number x is a gcd of a subsequence.
2. If there is such subsequence, then all of it will be divisible by x. Moreover, if you divide each number in the subsequence by x , then the gcd of the resulting numbers will be 1.
3. Adding a number to a subsequence cannot increase its gcd. So, if there is a valid subsequence for x , then the subsequence that contains all multiples of x is a valid one too.
4. Iterate on all possiblex from 1 to 10^5, and check if there is a valid subsequence for x.

## Test Cases

```
[6,10,3]

[5,15,40,5,6]
