# 1938. Maximum Genetic Difference Query

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** Array, Hash Table, Bit Manipulation, Depth-First Search, Trie
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-genetic-difference-query/

## Description

There is a rooted tree consisting of `n` nodes numbered `0` to `n - 1`. Each node's number denotes its **unique genetic value** (i.e. the genetic value of node `x` is `x`). The **genetic difference** between two genetic values is defined as the **bitwise-****XOR** of their values. You are given the integer array `parents`, where `parents[i]` is the parent for node `i`. If node `x` is the **root** of the tree, then `parents[x] == -1`.

You are also given the array `queries` where `queries[i] = [node_i, val_i]`. For each query `i`, find the **maximum genetic difference** between `val_i` and `p_i`, where `p_i` is the genetic value of any node that is on the path between `node_i` and the root (including `node_i` and the root). More formally, you want to maximize `val_i XOR p_i`.

Return *an array *`ans`* where *`ans[i]`* is the answer to the *`i^th`* query*.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** parents = [-1,0,1,1], queries = [[0,2],[3,2],[2,5]]
**Output:** [2,3,7]
**Explanation: **The queries are processed as follows:
- [0,2]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 0, with a difference of 2 XOR 0 = 2.
- [3,2]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 1, with a difference of 2 XOR 1 = 3.
- [2,5]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 2, with a difference of 5 XOR 2 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** parents = [3,7,-1,2,0,7,0,2], queries = [[4,6],[1,15],[0,5]]
**Output:** [6,14,7]
**Explanation: **The queries are processed as follows:
- [4,6]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 0, with a difference of 6 XOR 0 = 6.
- [1,15]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 1, with a difference of 15 XOR 1 = 14.
- [0,5]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 2, with a difference of 5 XOR 2 = 7.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= parents.length <= 10^5`
	- `0 <= parents[i] <= parents.length - 1` for every node `i` that is **not** the root.
	- `parents[root] == -1`
	- `1 <= queries.length <= 3 * 10^4`
	- `0 <= node_i <= parents.length - 1`
	- `0 <= val_i <= 2 * 10^5`

## Hints

1. How can we use a trie to store all the XOR values in the path from a node to the root?
2. How can we dynamically add the XOR values with a DFS search?

## Test Cases

```
[-1,0,1,1]
[[0,2],[3,2],[2,5]]
---
[3,7,-1,2,0,7,0,2]
[[4,6],[1,15],[0,5]]
