## Description

You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, each of length `n`, and a **1-indexed 2D array** `queries` where `queries[i] = [x_i, y_i]`.

For the `i^th` query, find the **maximum value** of `nums1[j] + nums2[j]` among all indices `j` `(0 <= j < n)`, where `nums1[j] >= x_i` and `nums2[j] >= y_i`, or **-1** if there is no `j` satisfying the constraints.

Return *an array *`answer`* where *`answer[i]`* is the answer to the *`i^th`* query.*

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** nums1 = [4,3,1,2], nums2 = [2,4,9,5], queries = [[4,1],[1,3],[2,5]]
**Output:** [6,10,7]
**Explanation:** 
For the 1st query x_i = 4 and y_i = 1, we can select index j = 0 since nums1[j] >= 4 and nums2[j] >= 1. The sum nums1[j] + nums2[j] is 6, and we can show that 6 is the maximum we can obtain.

For the 2nd query x_i = 1 and y_i = 3, we can select index j = 2 since nums1[j] >= 1 and nums2[j] >= 3. The sum nums1[j] + nums2[j] is 10, and we can show that 10 is the maximum we can obtain. 

For the 3rd query x_i = 2 and y_i = 5, we can select index j = 3 since nums1[j] >= 2 and nums2[j] >= 5. The sum nums1[j] + nums2[j] is 7, and we can show that 7 is the maximum we can obtain.

Therefore, we return [6,10,7].
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** nums1 = [3,2,5], nums2 = [2,3,4], queries = [[4,4],[3,2],[1,1]]
**Output:** [9,9,9]
**Explanation:** For this example, we can use index j = 2 for all the queries since it satisfies the constraints for each query.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** nums1 = [2,1], nums2 = [2,3], queries = [[3,3]]
**Output:** [-1]
**Explanation:** There is one query in this example with x_i = 3 and y_i = 3. For every index, j, either nums1[j] < x_i or nums2[j] < y_i. Hence, there is no solution.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `nums1.length == nums2.length` 
	- `n == nums1.length `
	- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^9 `
	- `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
	- `queries[i].length == 2`
	- `x_i == queries[i][1]`
	- `y_i == queries[i][2]`
	- `1 <= x_i, y_i <= 10^9`

## Hints

1. Sort (x, y) tuples and queries by x-coordinate descending. Don’t forget to index queries before sorting so that you can answer them in the correct order.
2. Before answering a query (min_x, min_y), add all (x, y) pairs with x >= min_x to some data structure.
3. Use a monotone descending map to store (y, x + y) pairs. A monotone map has ascending keys and descending values. When inserting a pair (y, x + y), remove all pairs (y', x' + y') with y' < y and x' + y' <= x + y.
4. To find the insertion position use binary search (built-in in many languages).
5. When querying for max (x + y) over y >= y', use binary search to find the first pair (y, x + y) with y >= y'. It will have the maximum value of x + y because the map has monotone descending values.
