# 3311. Construct 2D Grid Matching Graph Layout

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** Array, Hash Table, Graph Theory, Matrix
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-2d-grid-matching-graph-layout/

## Description

You are given a 2D integer array `edges` representing an **undirected** graph having `n` nodes, where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` denotes an edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i`.

Construct a 2D grid that satisfies these conditions:

	- The grid contains **all nodes** from `0` to `n - 1` in its cells, with each node appearing exactly **once**.
	- Two nodes should be in adjacent grid cells (**horizontally** or **vertically**) **if and only if** there is an edge between them in `edges`.

It is guaranteed that `edges` can form a 2D grid that satisfies the conditions.

Return a 2D integer array satisfying the conditions above. If there are multiple solutions, return *any* of them.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]]

**Output:** [[3,1],[2,0]]

**Explanation:**

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[2,4]]

**Output:** [[4,2,3,1,0]]

**Explanation:**

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 9, edges = [[0,1],[0,4],[0,5],[1,7],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5],[3,6],[4,6],[4,7],[6,8],[7,8]]

**Output:** [[8,6,3],[7,4,2],[1,0,5]]

**Explanation:**

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
	- `1 <= edges.length <= 10^5`
	- `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]`
	- `0 <= u_i < v_i < n`
	- All the edges are distinct.
	- The input is generated such that `edges` can form a 2D grid that satisfies the conditions.

## Hints

1. Observe the indegrees of the nodes.
2. The case where there are two nodes with an indegree of 1, and all the others have an indegree of 2 can be handled separately.
3. The nodes with the smallest degrees are the corners.
4. You can simulate the grid creation process using BFS or a similar approach after making some observations on the indegrees.
