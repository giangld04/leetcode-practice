# 3785. Minimum Swaps to Avoid Forbidden Values

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** Array, Hash Table, Greedy, Counting
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-swaps-to-avoid-forbidden-values/

## Description

You are given two integer arrays, `nums` and `forbidden`, each of length `n`.

You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

	- Choose two **distinct** indices `i` and `j`, and swap `nums[i]` with `nums[j]`.

Return the **minimum** number of swaps required such that, for every index `i`, the value of `nums[i]` is **not equal** to `forbidden[i]`. If no amount of swaps can ensure that every index avoids its forbidden value, return -1.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3], forbidden = [3,2,1]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

One optimal set of swaps:

	- Select indices `i = 0` and `j = 1` in `nums` and swap them, resulting in `nums = [2, 1, 3]`.
	- After this swap, for every index `i`, `nums[i]` is not equal to `forbidden[i]`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [4,6,6,5], forbidden = [4,6,5,5]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

One optimal set of swaps:

	- Select indices `i = 0` and `j = 2` in `nums` and swap them, resulting in `nums = [6, 6, 4, 5]`.
	- Select indices `i = 1` and `j = 3` in `nums` and swap them, resulting in `nums = [6, 5, 4, 6]`.
	- After these swaps, for every index `i`, `nums[i]` is not equal to `forbidden[i]`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [7,7], forbidden = [8,7]

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:**

It is not possible to make `nums[i]` different from `forbidden[i]` for all indices.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2], forbidden = [2,1]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

No swaps are required because `nums[i]` is already different from `forbidden[i]` for all indices, so the answer is 0.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n == nums.length == forbidden.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums[i], forbidden[i] <= 10^9`

## Hints

1. Solve the problem greedily.
2. Count combined frequencies of values in nums and forbidden into a map freq.
3. If any freq[val] >= n + 1 return -1 (impossible).
4. Collect bad positions (nums[i] == forbidden[i]) into a map badPairs[val] counts.
5. Let badPairsSum be the sum of all bad counts and maxBadPairs the maximum bad count for any single value.
6. The minimum swaps equals max((badPairsSum + 1) / 2, maxBadPairs) (i.e. ceil(badPairsSum/2) vs the largest same-value bad cluster).
