## Description

You are given an **undirected weighted** tree with n nodes, numbered from 0 to n - 1. It is represented by a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, w_i] indicates that there is an edge between nodes u_i and v_i with weight w_i.​

Additionally, you are given a 2D integer array queries, where queries[j] = [src1_j, src2_j, dest_j].

Return an array answer of length equal to queries.length, where answer[j] is the **minimum total weight** of a subtree such that it is possible to reach dest_j from both src1_j and src2_j using edges in this subtree.

A subtree here is any connected subset of nodes and edges of the original tree forming a valid tree.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** edges = [[0,1,2],[1,2,3],[1,3,5],[1,4,4],[2,5,6]], queries = [[2,3,4],[0,2,5]]

**Output:** [12,11]

**Explanation:**

The blue edges represent one of the subtrees that yield the optimal answer.

	
	`answer[0]`: The total weight of the selected subtree that ensures a path from `src1 = 2` and `src2 = 3` to `dest = 4` is `3 + 5 + 4 = 12`.

	
	
	`answer[1]`: The total weight of the selected subtree that ensures a path from `src1 = 0` and `src2 = 2` to `dest = 5` is `2 + 3 + 6 = 11`.

	

**Example 2:**

**Input:** edges = [[1,0,8],[0,2,7]], queries = [[0,1,2]]

**Output:** [15]

**Explanation:**

	- `answer[0]`: The total weight of the selected subtree that ensures a path from `src1 = 0` and `src2 = 1` to `dest = 2` is `8 + 7 = 15`.

**Constraints:**

	`3 <= n <= 10^5`
	`edges.length == n - 1`
	`edges[i].length == 3`
	`0 <= u_i, v_i < n`
	`1 <= w_i <= 10^4`
	`1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
	`queries[j].length == 3`
	`0 <= src1_j, src2_j, dest_j < n`
	- `src1_j`, `src2_j`, and `dest_j` are pairwise distinct.
	- The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.

## Hints

1. Binary lifting
2. Find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of any two nodes using binary lifting
3. For any node x, let f(x) be the distance from the root to x. Then for two nodes x and y:d(x, y) = f(x) + f(y) - 2 * f(LCA(x, y))
4. For three nodes a, b and c, the minimum total weight of the subtree connecting all three is:(d(a, b) + d(b, c) + d(c, a)) / 2, where d(x, y) is the distance between nodes x and y
