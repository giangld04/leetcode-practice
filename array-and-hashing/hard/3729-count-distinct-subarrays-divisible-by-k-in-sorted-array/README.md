# 3729. Count Distinct Subarrays Divisible by K in Sorted Array

**Tags:** Array, Hash Table, Prefix Sum
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-distinct-subarrays-divisible-by-k-in-sorted-array/

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` **sorted** in **non-descending** order and a positive integer `k`.

A **subarray** of `nums` is **good** if the sum of its elements is **divisible** by `k`.

Return an integer denoting the number of **distinct** **good** subarrays of `nums`.

Subarrays are **distinct** if their sequences of values are. For example, there are 3 **distinct** subarrays in `[1, 1, 1]`, namely `[1]`, `[1, 1]`, and `[1, 1, 1]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3], k = 3

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

The good subarrays are `[1, 2]`, `[3]`, and `[1, 2, 3]`. For example, `[1, 2, 3]` is good because the sum of its elements is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, and `6 % k = 6 % 3 = 0`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,2,2,2,2,2], k = 6

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The good subarrays are `[2, 2, 2]` and `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`. For example, `[2, 2, 2]` is good because the sum of its elements is `2 + 2 + 2 = 6`, and `6 % k = 6 % 6 = 0`.

Note that `[2, 2, 2]` is counted only once.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
	- `nums` is sorted in non-descending order.
	- `1 <= k <= 10^9`

## Hints

1. Use prefix sums.
2. Any subarray with >= 2 distinct values has a unique strict-increase boundary (i, j), so the value sequence is identified by that boundary and how many elements you take from each edge.
3. Count single-value sequences per run by testing (L*val) % k == 0.

## Test Cases

```
[1,2,3]
3

[2,2,2,2,2,2]
