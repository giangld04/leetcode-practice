# 3544. Subtree Inversion Sum

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** Array, Dynamic Programming, Tree, Depth-First Search
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-inversion-sum/

## Description

You are given an undirected tree rooted at node `0`, with `n` nodes numbered from 0 to `n - 1`. The tree is represented by a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates an edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i`.

You are also given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, where `nums[i]` represents the value at node `i`, and an integer `k`.

You may perform **inversion operations** on a subset of nodes subject to the following rules:

	
	Subtree Inversion Operation:

	
		
		When you invert a node, every value in the subtree rooted at that node is multiplied by -1.

		
	
	
	
	Distance Constraint on Inversions:

	
		
		You may only invert a node if it is "sufficiently far" from any other inverted node.

		
		
		Specifically, if you invert two nodes `a` and `b` such that one is an ancestor of the other (i.e., if `LCA(a, b) = a` or `LCA(a, b) = b`), then the distance (the number of edges on the unique path between them) must be at least `k`.

		
	
	

Return the **maximum** possible **sum** of the tree's node values after applying **inversion operations**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]], nums = [4,-8,-6,3,7,-2,5], k = 2

**Output:** 27

**Explanation:**

	- Apply inversion operations at nodes 0, 3, 4 and 6.
	- The final nums array is [-4, 8, 6, 3, 7, 2, 5], and the total sum is 27.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]], nums = [-1,3,-2,4,-5], k = 2

**Output:** 9

**Explanation:**

	- Apply the inversion operation at node 4.
	The final nums array becomes [-1, 3, -2, 4, 5], and the total sum is 9.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], nums = [0,-1,-2], k = 3

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

Apply inversion operations at nodes 1 and 2.

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
	- `edges.length == n - 1`
	- `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]`
	- `0 <= u_i, v_i < n`
	- `nums.length == n`
	- `-5 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 10^4`
	- `1 <= k <= 50`
	- The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.

## Hints

1. Use tree‑based dynamic programming
2. Define your DP state as dp[node][parityFromAncestorInversions][distSinceLastInversion]
3. node is the current tree node
4. parityFromAncestorInversions indicates whether the subtree values have been flipped an even (0) or odd (1) number of times by ancestor inversions
5. distSinceLastInversion tracks the number of edges from this node up to the most recent ancestor inversion
