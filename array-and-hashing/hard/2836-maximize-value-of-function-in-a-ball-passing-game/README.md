# 2836. Maximize Value of Function in a Ball Passing Game

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** Array, Dynamic Programming, Bit Manipulation
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-value-of-function-in-a-ball-passing-game/

## Description

You are given an integer array `receiver` of length `n` and an integer `k`. `n` players are playing a ball-passing game.

You choose the starting player, `i`. The game proceeds as follows: player `i` passes the ball to player `receiver[i]`, who then passes it to `receiver[receiver[i]]`, and so on, for `k` passes in total. The game's score is the sum of the indices of the players who touched the ball, including repetitions, i.e. `i + receiver[i] + receiver[receiver[i]] + ... + receiver^(k)[i]`.

Return the **maximum** possible score.

**Notes:**

	- `receiver` may contain duplicates.
	- `receiver[i]` may be equal to `i`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** receiver = [2,0,1], k = 4

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

Starting with player `i = 2` the initial score is 2:

	
		
			Pass
			Sender Index
			Receiver Index
			Score
		
		
			1
			2
			1
			3
		
		
			2
			1
			0
			3
		
		
			3
			0
			2
			5
		
		
			4
			2
			1
			6
		
	

**Example 2:**

**Input:** receiver = [1,1,1,2,3], k = 3

**Output:** 10

**Explanation:**

Starting with player `i = 4` the initial score is 4:

	
		
			Pass
			Sender Index
			Receiver Index
			Score
		
		
			1
			4
			3
			7
		
		
			2
			3
			2
			9
		
		
			3
			2
			1
			10
		
	

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= receiver.length == n <= 10^5`
	- `0 <= receiver[i] <= n - 1`
	- `1 <= k <= 10^10`

## Hints

1. We can solve the problem using binary lifting.
2. For each player with id x and for every i in the range [0, ceil(log2k)], we can determine the last receiver's id and compute the sum of player ids who receive the ball after 2i passes, starting from x.
3. Let last_receiver[x][i] = the last receiver's id after 2i passes, and sum[x][i] = the sum of player ids who receive the ball after 2i passes. For all x in the range [0, n - 1], last_receiver[x][0] = receiver[x], and sum[x][0] = receiver[x].
4. Then for i in range [1, ceil(log2k)], last_receiver[x][i] = last_receiver[last_receiver[x][i - 1]][i - 1] and sum[x][i] = sum[x][i - 1] + sum[last_receiver[x][i - 1]][i - 1], for all x in the range [0, n - 1].
5. Starting from each player id x, we can now go through the powers of 2 in the binary representation of k and make jumps corresponding to each power, using the pre-computed values, to compute f(x).
6. The answer is the maximum f(x) from each player id.
