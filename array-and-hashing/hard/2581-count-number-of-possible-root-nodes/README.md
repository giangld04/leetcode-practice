## Description

Alice has an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. The tree is represented as a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1` where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `a_i` and `b_i` in the tree.

Alice wants Bob to find the root of the tree. She allows Bob to make several **guesses** about her tree. In one guess, he does the following:

	- Chooses two **distinct** integers `u` and `v` such that there exists an edge `[u, v]` in the tree.
	- He tells Alice that `u` is the **parent** of `v` in the tree.

Bob's guesses are represented by a 2D integer array `guesses` where `guesses[j] = [u_j, v_j]` indicates Bob guessed `u_j` to be the parent of `v_j`.

Alice being lazy, does not reply to each of Bob's guesses, but just says that **at least** `k` of his guesses are `true`.

Given the 2D integer arrays `edges`, `guesses` and the integer `k`, return *the **number of possible nodes** that can be the root of Alice's tree*. If there is no such tree, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[4,2]], guesses = [[1,3],[0,1],[1,0],[2,4]], k = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 
Root = 0, correct guesses = [1,3], [0,1], [2,4]
Root = 1, correct guesses = [1,3], [1,0], [2,4]
Root = 2, correct guesses = [1,3], [1,0], [2,4]
Root = 3, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,4]
Root = 4, correct guesses = [1,3], [1,0]
Considering 0, 1, or 2 as root node leads to 3 correct guesses.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]], guesses = [[1,0],[3,4],[2,1],[3,2]], k = 1
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** 
Root = 0, correct guesses = [3,4]
Root = 1, correct guesses = [1,0], [3,4]
Root = 2, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,1], [3,4]
Root = 3, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,1], [3,2], [3,4]
Root = 4, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,1], [3,2]
Considering any node as root will give at least 1 correct guess.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `edges.length == n - 1`
	- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= guesses.length <= 10^5`
	- `0 <= a_i, b_i, u_j, v_j <= n - 1`
	- `a_i != b_i`
	- `u_j != v_j`
	- `edges` represents a valid tree.
	- `guesses[j]` is an edge of the tree.
	- `guesses` is unique.
	- `0 <= k <= guesses.length`

## Hints

1. How can we check if any node can be the root?
2. Can we use this information to check its neighboring nodes?
3. When we traverse from current node to a neighboring node, how will we update our answer?
