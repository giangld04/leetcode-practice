## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

A **subarray** is called **balanced** if the number of **distinct even** numbers in the subarray is equal to the number of **distinct odd** numbers.

Return the length of the **longest** balanced subarray.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,5,4,3]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

	- The longest balanced subarray is `[2, 5, 4, 3]`.
	- It has 2 distinct even numbers `[2, 4]` and 2 distinct odd numbers `[5, 3]`. Thus, the answer is 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,2,2,5,4]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

	- The longest balanced subarray is `[3, 2, 2, 5, 4]`.
	- It has 2 distinct even numbers `[2, 4]` and 2 distinct odd numbers `[3, 5]`. Thus, the answer is 5.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,2]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

	- The longest balanced subarray is `[2, 3, 2]`.
	- It has 1 distinct even number `[2]` and 1 distinct odd number `[3]`. Thus, the answer is 3.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## Hints

1. Store the first (or all) occurrences for each value in pos[val].
2. Build a lazy segment tree over start indices l in [0..n-1] that supports range add and can tell if any index has value 0 (keep mn/mx).
3. Use sign = +1 for odd values and sign = -1 for even values.
4. Initialize by adding each value's contribution with update(p, n-1, sign) where p is its current first occurrence.
5. Slide left l: pop pos[nums[l]], let next = next occurrence or n, do update(0, next-1, -sign), then query for any r >= l with value 0 and update ans = max(ans, r-l+1).
