## Description

You are given an integer `n` and an undirected tree rooted at node 0 with `n` nodes numbered from 0 to `n - 1`. This is represented by a 2D array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates an undirected edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i`.

You are also given an integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` is the positive integer assigned to node `i`.

Define a value `t_i` as the number of **ancestors** of node `i` such that the product `nums[i] * nums[ancestor]` is a **perfect square**.

Return the sum of all `t_i` values for all nodes `i` in range `[1, n - 1]`.

**Note**:

	- In a rooted tree, the **ancestors** of node `i` are all nodes on the path from node `i` to the root node 0, **excluding** `i` itself.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], nums = [2,8,2]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

	
		
			`**i**`
			**Ancestors**
			`**nums[i] * nums[ancestor]**`
			Square Check
			`**t_i**`
		
	
	
		
			1
			[0]
			`nums[1] * nums[0] = 8 * 2 = 16`
			16 is a perfect square
			1
		
		
			2
			[1, 0]
			`nums[2] * nums[1] = 2 * 8 = 16`

			`nums[2] * nums[0] = 2 * 2 = 4`
			Both 4 and 16 are perfect squares
			2
		
	

Thus, the total number of valid ancestor pairs across all non-root nodes is `1 + 2 = 3`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], nums = [1,2,4]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

	
		
			`**i**`
			**Ancestors**
			`**nums[i] * nums[ancestor]**`
			Square Check
			`**t_i**`
		
	
	
		
			1
			[0]
			`nums[1] * nums[0] = 2 * 1 = 2`
			2 is **not** a perfect square
			0
		
		
			2
			[0]
			`nums[2] * nums[0] = 4 * 1 = 4`
			4 is a perfect square
			1
		
	

Thus, the total number of valid ancestor pairs across all non-root nodes is 1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3]], nums = [1,2,9,4]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

	
		
			`i`
			**Ancestors**
			`**nums[i] * nums[ancestor]**`
			Square Check
			`**t_i**`
		
	
	
		
			1
			[0]
			`nums[1] * nums[0] = 2 * 1 = 2`
			2 is **not** a perfect square
			0
		
		
			2
			[0]
			`nums[2] * nums[0] = 9 * 1 = 9`
			9 is a perfect square
			1
		
		
			3
			[1, 0]
			`nums[3] * nums[1] = 4 * 2 = 8`

			`nums[3] * nums[0] = 4 * 1 = 4`
			Only 4 is a perfect square
			1
		
	

Thus, the total number of valid ancestor pairs across all non-root nodes is `0 + 1 + 1 = 2`.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
	- `edges.length == n - 1`
	- `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]`
	- `0 <= u_i, v_i <= n - 1`
	- `nums.length == n`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
	- The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.

## Hints

1. Notice that the product nums[i] * nums[ancestor] is a perfect square if and only if both numbers have the same "square-free kernel" (i.e., after removing all even powers of primes, the remaining product is identical).
2. Precompute the square-free representation of every node's value using prime factorization up to max(nums[i]).
3. Perform a DFS from the root. While traversing down the tree, maintain a frequency map of the square-free values of the ancestors.
4. For each node, the number of valid ancestors equals the count of ancestors with the same square-free value.
5. Carefully backtrack the frequency map after finishing a subtree to maintain correctness.
