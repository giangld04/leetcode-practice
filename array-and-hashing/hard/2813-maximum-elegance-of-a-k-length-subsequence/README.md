## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `items` of length `n` and an integer `k`.

`items[i] = [profit_i, category_i]`, where `profit_i` and `category_i` denote the profit and category of the `i^th` item respectively.

Let's define the **elegance** of a **subsequence** of `items` as `total_profit + distinct_categories^2`, where `total_profit` is the sum of all profits in the subsequence, and `distinct_categories` is the number of **distinct** categories from all the categories in the selected subsequence.

Your task is to find the **maximum elegance** from all subsequences of size `k` in `items`.

Return *an integer denoting the maximum elegance of a subsequence of *`items`* with size exactly *`k`.

**Note:** A subsequence of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** items = [[3,2],[5,1],[10,1]], k = 2
**Output:** 17
**Explanation: **In this example, we have to select a subsequence of size 2.
We can select items[0] = [3,2] and items[2] = [10,1].
The total profit in this subsequence is 3 + 10 = 13, and the subsequence contains 2 distinct categories [2,1].
Hence, the elegance is 13 + 2^2 = 17, and we can show that it is the maximum achievable elegance.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** items = [[3,1],[3,1],[2,2],[5,3]], k = 3
**Output:** 19
**Explanation:** In this example, we have to select a subsequence of size 3. 
We can select items[0] = [3,1], items[2] = [2,2], and items[3] = [5,3]. 
The total profit in this subsequence is 3 + 2 + 5 = 10, and the subsequence contains 3 distinct categories [1,2,3]. 
Hence, the elegance is 10 + 3^2 = 19, and we can show that it is the maximum achievable elegance.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** items = [[1,1],[2,1],[3,1]], k = 3
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** In this example, we have to select a subsequence of size 3. 
We should select all the items. 
The total profit will be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and the subsequence contains 1 distinct category [1]. 
Hence, the maximum elegance is 6 + 1^2 = 7.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= items.length == n <= 10^5`
	- `items[i].length == 2`
	- `items[i][0] == profit_i`
	- `items[i][1] == category_i`
	- `1 <= profit_i <= 10^9`
	- `1 <= category_i <= n `
	- `1 <= k <= n`

## Hints

1. Greedy algorithm.
2. Sort items in non-increasing order of profits.
3. Select the first k items (the top k most profitable items). Keep track of the items as the candidate set.
4. For the remaining n - k items sorted in non-increasing order of profits, try replacing an item in the candidate set using the current item.
5. The replacing item should add a new category to the candidate set and should remove the item with the minimum profit that occurs more than once in the candidate set.

## Test Cases
