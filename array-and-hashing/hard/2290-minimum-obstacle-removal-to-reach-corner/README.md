# 2290. Minimum Obstacle Removal to Reach Corner

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** Array, Breadth-First Search, Graph Theory, Heap (Priority Queue), Matrix, Shortest Path
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-obstacle-removal-to-reach-corner/

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `grid` of size `m x n`. Each cell has one of two values:

	- `0` represents an **empty** cell,
	- `1` represents an **obstacle** that may be removed.

You can move up, down, left, or right from and to an empty cell.

Return *the **minimum** number of **obstacles** to **remove** so you can move from the upper left corner *`(0, 0)`* to the lower right corner *`(m - 1, n - 1)`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** grid = [[0,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** We can remove the obstacles at (0, 1) and (0, 2) to create a path from (0, 0) to (2, 2).
It can be shown that we need to remove at least 2 obstacles, so we return 2.
Note that there may be other ways to remove 2 obstacles to create a path.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** grid = [[0,1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1,0]]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** We can move from (0, 0) to (2, 4) without removing any obstacles, so we return 0.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `m == grid.length`
	- `n == grid[i].length`
	- `1 <= m, n <= 10^5`
	- `2 <= m * n <= 10^5`
	- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` **or** `1`.
	- `grid[0][0] == grid[m - 1][n - 1] == 0`

## Hints

1. Model the grid as a graph where cells are nodes and edges are between adjacent cells. Edges to cells with obstacles have a cost of 1 and all other edges have a cost of 0.
2. Could you use 0-1 Breadth-First Search or Dijkstra’s algorithm?

## Test Cases

```
[[0,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]

[[0,1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1,0]]
