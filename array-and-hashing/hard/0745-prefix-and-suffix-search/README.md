# 745. Prefix and Suffix Search

## Description

Design a special dictionary that searches the words in it by a prefix and a suffix.

Implement the `WordFilter` class:

	- `WordFilter(string[] words)` Initializes the object with the `words` in the dictionary.
	- `f(string pref, string suff)` Returns *the index of the word in the dictionary,* which has the prefix `pref` and the suffix `suff`. If there is more than one valid index, return **the largest** of them. If there is no such word in the dictionary, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input**
["WordFilter", "f"]
[[["apple"]], ["a", "e"]]
**Output**
[null, 0]
**Explanation**
WordFilter wordFilter = new WordFilter(["apple"]);
wordFilter.f("a", "e"); // return 0, because the word at index 0 has prefix = "a" and suffix = "e".
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= words.length <= 10^4`
	- `1 <= words[i].length <= 7`
	- `1 <= pref.length, suff.length <= 7`
	- `words[i]`, `pref` and `suff` consist of lowercase English letters only.
	- At most `10^4` calls will be made to the function `f`.

## Hints

1. Take "apple" as an example, we will insert add "apple{apple", "pple{apple", "ple{apple", "le{apple", "e{apple", "{apple" into the Trie Tree.
2. If the query is: prefix = "app", suffix = "le", we can find it by querying our trie for
"le { app".
3. We use '{' because in ASCii Table, '{' is next to 'z', so we just need to create new TrieNode[27] instead of 26. Also, compared with traditional Trie, we add the attribute weight in class TrieNode.
You can still choose any different character.

## Test Cases

```
["WordFilter","f"]
[[["apple"]],["a","e"]]

```
