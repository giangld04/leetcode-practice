## Description

You are given an undirected graph defined by an integer `n`, the number of nodes, and a 2D integer array `edges`, the edges in the graph, where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates that there is an **undirected** edge between `u_i` and `v_i`. You are also given an integer array `queries`.

Let `incident(a, b)` be defined as the **number of edges** that are connected to **either** node `a` or `b`.

The answer to the `j^th` query is the **number of pairs** of nodes `(a, b)` that satisfy **both** of the following conditions:

	- `a < b`
	- `incident(a, b) > queries[j]`

Return *an array *`answers`* such that *`answers.length == queries.length`* and *`answers[j]`* is the answer of the *`j^th`* query*.

Note that there can be **multiple edges** between the same two nodes.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[1,2],[2,4],[1,3],[2,3],[2,1]], queries = [2,3]
**Output:** [6,5]
**Explanation:** The calculations for incident(a, b) are shown in the table above.
The answers for each of the queries are as follows:
- answers[0] = 6. All the pairs have an incident(a, b) value greater than 2.
- answers[1] = 5. All the pairs except (3, 4) have an incident(a, b) value greater than 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** n = 5, edges = [[1,5],[1,5],[3,4],[2,5],[1,3],[5,1],[2,3],[2,5]], queries = [1,2,3,4,5]
**Output:** [10,10,9,8,6]
```

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`
	- `1 <= edges.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= u_i, v_i <= n`
	- `u_i != v_i`
	- `1 <= queries.length <= 20`
	- `0 <= queries[j] < edges.length`

## Hints

1. We want to count pairs (x,y) such that degree[x] + degree[y] - occurrences(x,y) > k
2. Think about iterating on x, and counting the number of valid y to pair with x.
3. You can consider at first that the (- occurrences(x,y)) isn't there, or it is 0 at first for all y. Count the valid y this way.
4. Then you can iterate on the neighbors of x, let that neighbor be y, and update occurrences(x,y).
5. When you update occurrences(x,y), the left-hand side decreases. Once it reaches k, then y is not valid for x anymore, so you should decrease the answer by 1.

## Test Cases

```
4
[[1,2],[2,4],[1,3],[2,3],[2,1]]
[2,3]

5
[[1,5],[1,5],[3,4],[2,5],[1,3],[5,1],[2,3],[2,5]]
[1,2,3,4,5]
