# 2862. Maximum Element-Sum of a Complete Subset of Indices

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** Array, Math, Number Theory
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-element-sum-of-a-complete-subset-of-indices/

## Description

You are given a **1****-indexed** array `nums`. Your task is to select a **complete subset** from `nums` where every pair of selected indices multiplied is a perfect square,. i. e. if you select `a_i` and `a_j`, `i * j` must be a perfect square.

Return the *sum* of the complete subset with the *maximum sum*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [8,7,3,5,7,2,4,9]

**Output:** 16

**Explanation:**

We select elements at indices 2 and 8 and `2 * 8` is a perfect square.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [8,10,3,8,1,13,7,9,4]

**Output:** 20

**Explanation:**

We select elements at indices 1, 4, and 9. `1 * 4`, `1 * 9`, `4 * 9` are perfect squares.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n == nums.length <= 10^4`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Hints

1. Define P(x) as the product of primes p with odd exponents in x's factorization. Examples: For x = 18, factorization 21 × 32, P(18) = 2; for x = 45, factorization 32 × 51, P(45) = 5; for x = 50, factorization 21 × 52, P(50) = 2; for x = 210, factorization 21 × 31 × 51 × 71, P(210) = 210.
2. If P(i) = P(j), nums[i] and nums[j] can be grouped together.
3. Pick the group with the largest sum.
