## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `goal`.

You want to choose a subsequence of `nums` such that the sum of its elements is the closest possible to `goal`. That is, if the sum of the subsequence's elements is `sum`, then you want to **minimize the absolute difference** `abs(sum - goal)`.

Return *the **minimum** possible value of* `abs(sum - goal)`.

Note that a subsequence of an array is an array formed by removing some elements **(possibly all or none)** of the original array.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** nums = [5,-7,3,5], goal = 6
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** Choose the whole array as a subsequence, with a sum of 6.
This is equal to the goal, so the absolute difference is 0.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** nums = [7,-9,15,-2], goal = -5
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** Choose the subsequence [7,-9,-2], with a sum of -4.
The absolute difference is abs(-4 - (-5)) = abs(1) = 1, which is the minimum.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** nums = [1,2,3], goal = -7
**Output:** 7
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 40`
	- `-10^7 <= nums[i] <= 10^7`
	- `-10^9 <= goal <= 10^9`

## Hints

1. The naive solution is to check all possible subsequences. This works in O(2^n).
2. Divide the array into two parts of nearly is equal size.
3. Consider all subsets of one part and make a list of all possible subset sums and sort this list.
4. Consider all subsets of the other part, and for each one, let its sum = x, do binary search to get the nearest possible value to goal - x in the first part.
