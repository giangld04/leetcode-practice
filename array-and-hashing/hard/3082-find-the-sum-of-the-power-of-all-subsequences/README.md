## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and a **positive** integer `k`.

The **power** of an array of integers is defined as the number of subsequences with their sum **equal** to `k`.

Return *the **sum** of **power** of all subsequences of* `nums`*.*

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input: **  nums = [1,2,3], k = 3 

**Output: **  6 

**Explanation:**

There are `5` subsequences of nums with non-zero power:

	- The subsequence `[**1**,**2**,**3**]` has `2` subsequences with `sum == 3`: `[1,2,3]` and `[1,2,3]`.
	- The subsequence `[**1**,2,**3**]` has `1` subsequence with `sum == 3`: `[1,2,3]`.
	- The subsequence `[1,**2**,**3**]` has `1` subsequence with `sum == 3`: `[1,2,3]`.
	- The subsequence `[**1**,**2**,3]` has `1` subsequence with `sum == 3`: `[1,2,3]`.
	- The subsequence `[1,2,**3**]` has `1` subsequence with `sum == 3`: `[1,2,3]`.

Hence the answer is `2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6`.

**Example 2:**

**Input: **  nums = [2,3,3], k = 5 

**Output: **  4 

**Explanation:**

There are `3` subsequences of nums with non-zero power:

	- The subsequence `[**2**,**3**,**3**]` has 2 subsequences with `sum == 5`: `[2,3,3]` and `[2,3,3]`.
	- The subsequence `[**2**,3,**3**]` has 1 subsequence with `sum == 5`: `[2,3,3]`.
	- The subsequence `[**2**,**3**,3]` has 1 subsequence with `sum == 5`: `[2,3,3]`.

Hence the answer is `2 + 1 + 1 = 4`.

**Example 3:**

**Input: **  nums = [1,2,3], k = 7 

**Output: **  0 

**Explanation: **There exists no subsequence with sum `7`. Hence all subsequences of nums have `power = 0`.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 100`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
	- `1 <= k <= 100`

## Hints

1. If there is a subsequence of length j with the sum of elements k, it contributes 2n - j to the answer.
2. Let dp[i][j] represent the number of subsequences in the subarray nums[0..i] which have a sum of j.
3. We can find the dp[i][k] for all 0  and multiply them with 2n - j to get final answer.
