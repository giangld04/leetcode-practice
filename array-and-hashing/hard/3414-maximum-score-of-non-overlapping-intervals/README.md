**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** Array, Binary Search, Dynamic Programming, Sorting
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-of-non-overlapping-intervals/

## Description

You are given a 2D integer array `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [l_i, r_i, weight_i]`. Interval `i` starts at position `l_i` and ends at `r_i`, and has a weight of `weight_i`. You can choose *up to* 4 **non-overlapping** intervals. The **score** of the chosen intervals is defined as the total sum of their weights.

Return the lexicographically smallest array of at most 4 indices from `intervals` with **maximum** score, representing your choice of non-overlapping intervals.

Two intervals are said to be **non-overlapping** if they do not share any points. In particular, intervals sharing a left or right boundary are considered overlapping.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,3,2],[4,5,2],[1,5,5],[6,9,3],[6,7,1],[8,9,1]]

**Output:** [2,3]

**Explanation:**

You can choose the intervals with indices 2, and 3 with respective weights of 5, and 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intervals = [[5,8,1],[6,7,7],[4,7,3],[9,10,6],[7,8,2],[11,14,3],[3,5,5]]

**Output:** [1,3,5,6]

**Explanation:**

You can choose the intervals with indices 1, 3, 5, and 6 with respective weights of 7, 6, 3, and 5.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= intevals.length <= 5 * 10^4`
	- `intervals[i].length == 3`
	- `intervals[i] = [l_i, r_i, weight_i]`
	- `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= 10^9`
	- `1 <= weight_i <= 10^9`

## Hints

1. Use Dynamic Programming.
2. Sort intervals by right boundary.
3. Let dp[r][i] denote the maximum score having picked r intervals from the prefix of intervals ending at index i.
4. dp[r][i] = max(dp[r][i - 1], intervals[i][2] + dp[r][j]) where j is the largest index such that intervals[j][1] .
5. Since intervals is sorted by right boundary, we can find index j using binary search.
