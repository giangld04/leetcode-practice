## Description

You are given a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [x_i, y_i]` represents the coordinates of the `i^th` point on the Cartesian plane.

Return the number of unique *trapezoids* that can be formed by choosing any four distinct points from `points`.

A **trapezoid** is a convex quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides. Two lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** points = [[-3,2],[3,0],[2,3],[3,2],[2,-3]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

 

There are two distinct ways to pick four points that form a trapezoid:

	- The points `[-3,2], [2,3], [3,2], [2,-3]` form one trapezoid.
	- The points `[2,3], [3,2], [3,0], [2,-3]` form another trapezoid.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** points = [[0,0],[1,0],[0,1],[2,1]]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

There is only one trapezoid which can be formed.

**Constraints:**

	- `4 <= points.length <= 500`
	- `–1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000`
	- All points are pairwise distinct.

## Hints

1. Hash every point-pair by its reduced slope (dy,dx) (normalize with GCD and fix signs).
2. In each slope-bucket of size k, there are C(k,2) ways to pick two segments as the trapezoid's parallel bases.
3. Skip any base-pair that shares an endpoint since it would not form a quadrilateral.
4. Subtract one count for each parallelogram. Each parallelogram was counted once for each of its two parallel-side pairs, so after subtracting once, every quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides, including parallelograms, contributes exactly one to the final total.
5. Final answer = total valid base-pairs minus parallelogram overcounts.
