## Description

Given an array of strings `queries` and a string `pattern`, return a boolean array `answer` where `answer[i]` is `true` if `queries[i]` matches `pattern`, and `false` otherwise.

A query word `queries[i]` matches `pattern` if you can insert lowercase English letters into the pattern so that it equals the query. You may insert a character at any position in pattern or you may choose not to insert any characters **at all**.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** queries = ["FooBar","FooBarTest","FootBall","FrameBuffer","ForceFeedBack"], pattern = "FB"
**Output:** [true,false,true,true,false]
**Explanation:** "FooBar" can be generated like this "F" + "oo" + "B" + "ar".
"FootBall" can be generated like this "F" + "oot" + "B" + "all".
"FrameBuffer" can be generated like this "F" + "rame" + "B" + "uffer".
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** queries = ["FooBar","FooBarTest","FootBall","FrameBuffer","ForceFeedBack"], pattern = "FoBa"
**Output:** [true,false,true,false,false]
**Explanation:** "FooBar" can be generated like this "Fo" + "o" + "Ba" + "r".
"FootBall" can be generated like this "Fo" + "ot" + "Ba" + "ll".
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** queries = ["FooBar","FooBarTest","FootBall","FrameBuffer","ForceFeedBack"], pattern = "FoBaT"
**Output:** [false,true,false,false,false]
**Explanation:** "FooBarTest" can be generated like this "Fo" + "o" + "Ba" + "r" + "T" + "est".
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= pattern.length, queries.length <= 100`
	- `1 <= queries[i].length <= 100`
	- `queries[i]` and `pattern` consist of English letters.

## Hints

1. Given a single pattern and word, how can we solve it?
2. One way to do it is using a DP (pos1, pos2) where pos1 is a pointer to the word and pos2 to the pattern and returns true if we can match the pattern with the given word.
3. We have two scenarios: The first one is when `word[pos1] == pattern[pos2]`, then the transition will be just DP(pos1 + 1, pos2 + 1). The second scenario is when `word[pos1]` is lowercase then we can add this character to the pattern so that the transition is just DP(pos1 + 1, pos2)
The case base is `if (pos1 == n && pos2 == m) return true;` Where n and m are the sizes of the strings word and pattern respectively.

## Test Cases

["FooBar","FooBarTest","FootBall","FrameBuffer","ForceFeedBack"]
"FoBaT"
