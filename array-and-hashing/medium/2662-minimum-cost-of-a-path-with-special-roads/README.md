# 2662. Minimum Cost of a Path With Special Roads

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Graph Theory, Heap (Priority Queue), Shortest Path

## Description

You are given an array `start` where `start = [startX, startY]` represents your initial position `(startX, startY)` in a 2D space. You are also given the array `target` where `target = [targetX, targetY]` represents your target position `(targetX, targetY)`.

The **cost** of going from a position `(x1, y1)` to any other position in the space `(x2, y2)` is `|x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1|`.

There are also some **special roads**. You are given a 2D array `specialRoads` where `specialRoads[i] = [x1_i, y1_i, x2_i, y2_i, cost_i]` indicates that the `i^th` special road goes in **one direction** from `(x1_i, y1_i)` to `(x2_i, y2_i)` with a cost equal to `cost_i`. You can use each special road any number of times.

Return the **minimum** cost required to go from `(startX, startY)` to `(targetX, targetY)`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** start = [1,1], target = [4,5], specialRoads = [[1,2,3,3,2],[3,4,4,5,1]]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

	- (1,1) to (1,2) with a cost of |1 - 1| + |2 - 1| = 1.
	- (1,2) to (3,3). Use `specialRoads[0]` with the cost 2.
	- (3,3) to (3,4) with a cost of |3 - 3| + |4 - 3| = 1.
	- (3,4) to (4,5). Use `specialRoads[1]` with the cost 1.

So the total cost is 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 5.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** start = [3,2], target = [5,7], specialRoads = [[5,7,3,2,1],[3,2,3,4,4],[3,3,5,5,5],[3,4,5,6,6]]

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:**

It is optimal not to use any special edges and go directly from the starting to the ending position with a cost |5 - 3| + |7 - 2| = 7.

Note that the `specialRoads[0]` is directed from (5,7) to (3,2).

**Example 3:**

**Input:** start = [1,1], target = [10,4], specialRoads = [[4,2,1,1,3],[1,2,7,4,4],[10,3,6,1,2],[6,1,1,2,3]]

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:**

	- (1,1) to (1,2) with a cost of |1 - 1| + |2 - 1| = 1.
	- (1,2) to (7,4). Use `specialRoads[1]` with the cost 4.
	- (7,4) to (10,4) with a cost of |10 - 7| + |4 - 4| = 3.

**Constraints:**

	- `start.length == target.length == 2`
	- `1 <= startX <= targetX <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= startY <= targetY <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= specialRoads.length <= 200`
	- `specialRoads[i].length == 5`
	- `startX <= x1_i, x2_i <= targetX`
	- `startY <= y1_i, y2_i <= targetY`
	- `1 <= cost_i <= 10^5`

## Hints

1. It can be proven that it is optimal to go only to the positions that are either the start or the end of a special road or the target position.
2. Consider all positions given to you as nodes in a graph, and the edges of the graph are the special roads.
3. Now the problem is equivalent to finding the shortest path in a directed graph.
