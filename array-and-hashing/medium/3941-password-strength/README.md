# 3941. Password Strength

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Hash Table, String
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/password-strength/

## Description

You are given a string `password`.

The **strength** of the password is calculated based on the following rules:

	- 1 point for each distinct lowercase letter (`'a'` to `'z'`).
	- 2 points for each distinct uppercase letter (`'A'` to `'Z'`).
	- 3 points for each distinct digit (`'0'` to `'9'`).
	- 5 points for each distinct special character from the set `"!@#$"`.

Each character contributes **at most** once, even if it appears multiple times.

Return an integer denoting the strength of the password.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** password = "aA1!"

**Output:** 11

**Explanation:**

	- The distinct characters are `'a'`, `'A'`, `'1'` and `'!'`.
	- Thus, the `strength = 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** password = "bbB11#"

**Output:** 11

**Explanation:**

	- The distinct characters are `'b'`, `'B'`, `'1'` and `'#'`.
	- Thus, the `strength = 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11`.​​​​​​​

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= password.length <= 10^5`
	- `password` consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters, digits, and special characters from `"!@#$"`.

## Hints

1. Remove duplicates from the string.
2. Now you can sum up the corresponding points of each character.

## Test Cases

```
"aA1!"
---
"bbB11#"
---
```
