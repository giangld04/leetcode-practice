# 1806. Minimum Number of Operations to Reinitialize a Permutation

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Math, Simulation

## Description

You are given an **even** integer `n`​​​​​​. You initially have a permutation `perm` of size `n`​​ where `perm[i] == i`​ **(0-indexed)**​​​​.

In one operation, you will create a new array `arr`, and for each `i`:

	- If `i % 2 == 0`, then `arr[i] = perm[i / 2]`.
	- If `i % 2 == 1`, then `arr[i] = perm[n / 2 + (i - 1) / 2]`.

You will then assign `arr`​​​​ to `perm`.

Return *the minimum **non-zero** number of operations you need to perform on *`perm`* to return the permutation to its initial value.*

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** perm = [0,1] initially.
After the 1^st operation, perm = [0,1]
So it takes only 1 operation.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** n = 4
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** perm = [0,1,2,3] initially.
After the 1^st operation, perm = [0,2,1,3]
After the 2^nd operation, perm = [0,1,2,3]
So it takes only 2 operations.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** n = 6
**Output:** 4
```

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= n <= 1000`
	- `n`​​​​​​ is even.

## Hints

1. It is safe to assume the number of  operations isn't more than n
2. The number is small enough to apply a brute force solution.
