# 2568. Minimum Impossible OR

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Bit Manipulation, Brainteaser
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-impossible-or/

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`.

We say that an integer x is **expressible** from `nums` if there exist some integers `0 <= index_1 < index_2 < ... < index_k < nums.length` for which `nums[index_1] | nums[index_2] | ... | nums[index_k] = x`. In other words, an integer is expressible if it can be written as the bitwise OR of some subsequence of `nums`.

Return *the minimum **positive non-zero integer** that is not **expressible from *`nums`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** nums = [2,1]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** 1 and 2 are already present in the array. We know that 3 is expressible, since nums[0] | nums[1] = 2 | 1 = 3. Since 4 is not expressible, we return 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** nums = [5,3,2]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** We can show that 1 is the smallest number that is not expressible.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Hints

1. Think about forming numbers in the powers of 2 using their bit representation.
2. The minimum power of 2 not present in the array will be the first number that could not be expressed using the given operation.

## Test Cases

```
[2,1]
---
[5,3,2]

```
