# 3676. Count Bowl Subarrays

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Stack, Monotonic Stack
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-bowl-subarrays/

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` with **distinct** elements.

A subarray `nums[l...r]` of `nums` is called a **bowl** if:

	- The subarray has length at least 3. That is, `r - l + 1 >= 3`.
	- The **minimum** of its two ends is **strictly greater** than the **maximum** of all elements in between. That is, `min(nums[l], nums[r]) > max(nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1])`.

Return the number of **bowl** subarrays in `nums`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,5,3,1,4]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The bowl subarrays are `[3, 1, 4]` and `[5, 3, 1, 4]`.

	- `[3, 1, 4]` is a bowl because `min(3, 4) = 3 > max(1) = 1`.
	- `[5, 3, 1, 4]` is a bowl because `min(5, 4) = 4 > max(3, 1) = 3`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [5,1,2,3,4]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

The bowl subarrays are `[5, 1, 2]`, `[5, 1, 2, 3]` and `[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1000000000,999999999,999999998]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

No subarray is a bowl.

**Constraints:**

	- `3 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
	- `nums` consists of distinct elements.

## Hints

1. Use monotonic stacks to find nearest greater elements on both sides.
2. The bowl condition depends on comparing both ends with the maximum of the middle - avoid recomputing max by preprocessing.
3. Think in terms of "valid endpoints" rather than enumerating all subarrays.
4. There's symmetry: you can check both (left endpoint is smaller) and (right endpoint is smaller) cases separately.

## Test Cases

[5,1,2,3,4]
