## Description

You are given a list of songs where the `i^th` song has a duration of `time[i]` seconds.

Return *the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by* `60`. Formally, we want the number of indices `i`, `j` such that `i < j` with `(time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** time = [30,20,150,100,40]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** time = [60,60,60]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= time.length <= 6 * 10^4`
	- `1 <= time[i] <= 500`

## Hints

1. We only need to consider each song length modulo 60.
2. We can count the number of songs having same (length % 60), and store that in an array of size 60.

## Test Cases

```
[30,20,150,100,40]

[60,60,60]
