# 1962. Remove Stones to Minimize the Total

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Greedy, Heap (Priority Queue)
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-stones-to-minimize-the-total/

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `piles`, where `piles[i]` represents the number of stones in the `i^th` pile, and an integer `k`. You should apply the following operation **exactly** `k` times:

	- Choose any `piles[i]` and **remove** `floor(piles[i] / 2)` stones from it.

**Notice** that you can apply the operation on the **same** pile more than once.

Return *the **minimum** possible total number of stones remaining after applying the *`k`* operations*.

`floor(x)` is the **largest** integer that is **smaller** than or **equal** to `x` (i.e., rounds `x` down).

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** piles = [5,4,9], k = 2
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:** Steps of a possible scenario are:
- Apply the operation on pile 2. The resulting piles are [5,4,5].
- Apply the operation on pile 0. The resulting piles are [3,4,5].
The total number of stones in [3,4,5] is 12.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** piles = [4,3,6,7], k = 3
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:** Steps of a possible scenario are:
- Apply the operation on pile 2. The resulting piles are [4,3,3,7].
- Apply the operation on pile 3. The resulting piles are [4,3,3,4].
- Apply the operation on pile 0. The resulting piles are [2,3,3,4].
The total number of stones in [2,3,3,4] is 12.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= piles.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= piles[i] <= 10^4`
	- `1 <= k <= 10^5`

## Hints

1. Choose the pile with the maximum number of stones each time.
2. Use a data structure that helps you find the mentioned pile each time efficiently.
3. One such data structure is a Priority Queue.
