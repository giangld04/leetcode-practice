## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

An array is considered **alternating prime** if:

	- Elements at **even** indices (0-based) are **prime** numbers.
	- Elements at **odd** indices are **non-prime** numbers.

In one operation, you may **increment** any element by 1.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to transform `nums` into an **alternating prime** array.

A **prime** number is a natural number greater than 1 with only two factors, 1 and itself.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

	- The element at index 0 must be prime. Increment `nums[0] = 1` to 2, using 1 operation.
	- The element at index 1 must be non-prime. Increment `nums[1] = 2` to 4, using 2 operations.
	- The element at index 2 is already prime.
	- The element at index 3 is already non-prime.

Total operations = `1 + 2 = 3`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [5,6,7,8]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

	- The elements at indices 0 and 2 are already prime.
	- The elements at indices 1 and 3 are already non-prime.

No operations are needed.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [4,4]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

	- The element at index 0 must be prime. Increment `nums[0] = 4` to 5, using 1 operation.
	- The element at index 1 is already non-prime.

Total operations = 1.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## Hints

1. Each index can be handled independently. Focus on making each element valid with the minimum increments.
2. For even indices, find the smallest prime >= nums[i].
3. For odd indices, find the smallest non-prime >= nums[i].
4. Precompute primes efficiently (e.g., Sieve of Eratosthenes) to quickly check or jump to the next valid number.
5. For odd indices, note that any number > 2 becomes non-prime after at most 1 increment (except 2).
