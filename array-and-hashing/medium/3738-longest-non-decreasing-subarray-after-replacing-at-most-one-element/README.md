**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-non-decreasing-subarray-after-replacing-at-most-one-element/

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

You are allowed to replace **at most** one element in the array with any other integer value of your choice.

Return the length of the **longest non-decreasing subarray** that can be obtained after performing at most one replacement.

An array is said to be **non-decreasing** if each element is greater than or equal to its previous one (if it exists).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,1,2]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

Replacing `nums[3] = 1` with 3 gives the array [1, 2, 3, 3, 2].

The longest non-decreasing subarray is [1, 2, 3, 3], which has a length of 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,2,2,2,2]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

All elements in `nums` are equal, so it is already non-decreasing and the entire `nums` forms a subarray of length 5.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
	- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`​​​​​​​

## Hints

1. Use prefix and suffix arrays
2. Create a prefix array where pref[i] denotes the maximum-length non-decreasing subarray ending at i
3. Create a suffix array where suff[i] denotes the maximum-length non-decreasing subarray starting at i
4. Let the initial maximum be max(max(pref), max(suff))
5. For each index i, try to combine the prefix ending at i - 1 and the suffix starting at i + 1 if possible; also consider the maximum without combining them

## Test Cases

[1,2,3,1,2]
