# 930. Binary Subarrays With Sum

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Hash Table, Sliding Window, Prefix Sum
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum/

## Description

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `goal`, return *the number of non-empty **subarrays** with a sum* `goal`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous part of the array.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** nums = [1,0,1,0,1], goal = 2
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The 4 subarrays are bolded and underlined below:
[**1,0,1**,0,1]
[**1,0,1,0**,1]
[1,**0,1,0,1**]
[1,0,**1,0,1**]
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** nums = [0,0,0,0,0], goal = 0
**Output:** 15
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
	- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.
	- `0 <= goal <= nums.length`

## Hints

1. Can you transform the problem into finding two prefix sums whose difference equals goal?
2. While iterating through the array, keep track of how many times each prefix sum has appeared so far.
3. If the current prefix sum is curr, how many previous prefix sums equal to curr - goal exist?

## Test Cases

```
[1,0,1,0,1]
2
---
[0,0,0,0,0]
0
---
```
