# 3724. Minimum Operations to Transform Array

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Greedy
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-transform-array/

## Description

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` of length `n` and `nums2` of length `n + 1`.

You want to transform `nums1` into `nums2` using the **minimum** number of operations.

You may perform the following operations **any** number of times, each time choosing an index `i`:

	- **Increase** `nums1[i]` by 1.
	- **Decrease** `nums1[i]` by 1.
	- **Append** `nums1[i]` to the **end** of the array.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to transform `nums1` into `nums2`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = [2,8], nums2 = [1,7,3]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

	
		
			Step
			`i`
			Operation
			`nums1[i]`
			Updated `nums1`
		
	
	
		
			1
			0
			Append
			-
			[2, 8, 2]
		
		
			2
			0
			Decrement
			Decreases to 1
			[1, 8, 2]
		
		
			3
			1
			Decrement
			Decreases to 7
			[1, 7, 2]
		
		
			4
			2
			Increment
			Increases to 3
			[1, 7, 3]
		
	

Thus, after 4 operations `nums1` is transformed into `nums2`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = [1,3,6], nums2 = [2,4,5,3]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

	
		
			Step
			`i`
			Operation
			`nums1[i]`
			Updated `nums1`
		
	
	
		
			1
			1
			Append
			-
			[1, 3, 6, 3]
		
		
			2
			0
			Increment
			Increases to 2
			[2, 3, 6, 3]
		
		
			3
			1
			Increment
			Increases to 4
			[2, 4, 6, 3]
		
		
			4
			2
			Decrement
			Decreases to 5
			[2, 4, 5, 3]
		
	

Thus, after 4 operations `nums1` is transformed into `nums2`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums1 = [2], nums2 = [3,4]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

	
		
			Step
			`i`
			Operation
			`nums1[i]`
			Updated `nums1`
		
	
	
		
			1
			0
			Increment
			Increases to 3
			[3]
		
		
			2
			0
			Append
			-
			[3, 3]
		
		
			3
			1
			Increment
			Increases to 4
			[3, 4]
		
	

Thus, after 3 operations `nums1` is transformed into `nums2`.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n == nums1.length <= 10^5`
	- `nums2.length == n + 1`
	- `1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^5`

## Hints

1. Notice that nums2 has exactly one extra element compared to nums1. That extra element must be produced by an append operation.
2. Suppose we choose index j in nums1 to append. Then nums1[j] must eventually become both nums2[j] and nums2.back().
3. The cost for index j is: adjust nums1[j] so that one copy matches nums2[j] and the appended copy matches nums2.back().
4. For each j, compute this adjustment cost, add the cost of transforming all other positions, and take the minimum.
5. Use prefix sums.
