## Description

You are given a 2D integer array `stockPrices` where `stockPrices[i] = [day_i, price_i]` indicates the price of the stock on day `day_i` is `price_i`. A **line chart** is created from the array by plotting the points on an XY plane with the X-axis representing the day and the Y-axis representing the price and connecting adjacent points. One such example is shown below:

Return *the **minimum number of lines** needed to represent the line chart*.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** stockPrices = [[1,7],[2,6],[3,5],[4,4],[5,4],[6,3],[7,2],[8,1]]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
The diagram above represents the input, with the X-axis representing the day and Y-axis representing the price.
The following 3 lines can be drawn to represent the line chart:
- Line 1 (in red) from (1,7) to (4,4) passing through (1,7), (2,6), (3,5), and (4,4).
- Line 2 (in blue) from (4,4) to (5,4).
- Line 3 (in green) from (5,4) to (8,1) passing through (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), and (8,1).
It can be shown that it is not possible to represent the line chart using less than 3 lines.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** stockPrices = [[3,4],[1,2],[7,8],[2,3]]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:**
As shown in the diagram above, the line chart can be represented with a single line.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= stockPrices.length <= 10^5`
	- `stockPrices[i].length == 2`
	- `1 <= day_i, price_i <= 10^9`
	- All `day_i` are **distinct**.

## Hints

1. When will three adjacent points lie on the same line? How can we generalize this for all points?
2. Will calculating the slope of lines connecting adjacent points help us find the answer?

## Test Cases

```
[[1,7],[2,6],[3,5],[4,4],[5,4],[6,3],[7,2],[8,1]]
---
[[3,4],[1,2],[7,8],[2,3]]
