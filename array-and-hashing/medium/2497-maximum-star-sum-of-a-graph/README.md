## Description

There is an undirected graph consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `vals` of length `n` where `vals[i]` denotes the value of the `i^th` node.

You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` denotes that there exists an **undirected** edge connecting nodes `a_i` and `b_i.`

A **star graph** is a subgraph of the given graph having a center node containing `0` or more neighbors. In other words, it is a subset of edges of the given graph such that there exists a common node for all edges.

The image below shows star graphs with `3` and `4` neighbors respectively, centered at the blue node.

The **star sum** is the sum of the values of all the nodes present in the star graph.

Given an integer `k`, return *the **maximum star sum** of a star graph containing **at most** *`k`* edges.*

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** vals = [1,2,3,4,10,-10,-20], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4],[3,5],[3,6]], k = 2
**Output:** 16
**Explanation:** The above diagram represents the input graph.
The star graph with the maximum star sum is denoted by blue. It is centered at 3 and includes its neighbors 1 and 4.
It can be shown it is not possible to get a star graph with a sum greater than 16.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** vals = [-5], edges = [], k = 0
**Output:** -5
**Explanation:** There is only one possible star graph, which is node 0 itself.
Hence, we return -5.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `n == vals.length`
	- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
	- `-10^4 <= vals[i] <= 10^4`
	- `0 <= edges.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2``, 10^5)`
	- `edges[i].length == 2`
	- `0 <= a_i, b_i <= n - 1`
	- `a_i != b_i`
	- `0 <= k <= n - 1`

## Hints

1. A star graph doesn’t necessarily include all of its neighbors.
2. For each node, sort its neighbors in descending order and take k max valued neighbors.

## Test Cases

```
[1,2,3,4,10,-10,-20]
[[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4],[3,5],[3,6]]
