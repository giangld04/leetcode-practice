# 3714. Longest Balanced Substring II

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Hash Table, String, Prefix Sum
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-balanced-substring-ii/

## Description

You are given a string `s` consisting only of the characters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.

A **substring** of `s` is called **balanced** if all **distinct** characters in the **substring** appear the **same** number of times.

Return the **length of the longest balanced substring** of `s`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abbac"

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

The longest balanced substring is `"abba"` because both distinct characters `'a'` and `'b'` each appear exactly 2 times.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "aabcc"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

The longest balanced substring is `"abc"` because all distinct characters `'a'`, `'b'` and `'c'` each appear exactly 1 time.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "aba"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

One of the longest balanced substrings is `"ab"` because both distinct characters `'a'` and `'b'` each appear exactly 1 time. Another longest balanced substring is `"ba"`.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
	- `s` contains only the characters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.

## Hints

1. Solve for three cases: all-equal characters, exactly two distinct characters, and all three characters present. Treat each case separately and take the maximum length.
2. Case 1: single character: the longest balanced substring is the longest run of the same character; report its length.
3. Case 2: two distinct characters: reduce to that pair (ignore the third character) and use prefix differences of their counts; equal counts between two indices mean the substring between them is balanced for those two chars.
4. Case 3: all three characters: use prefix counts and hash the pair (count_b - count_a, count_c - count_a) for each prefix; if the same pair appears at two indices the substring between them has equal counts for a, b, and c. Store earliest index per pair to get maximal length.

## Test Cases

"abbac"
