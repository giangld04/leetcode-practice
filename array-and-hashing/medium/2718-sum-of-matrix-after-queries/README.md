# 2718. Sum of Matrix After Queries

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Hash Table
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-matrix-after-queries/

## Description

You are given an integer `n` and a **0-indexed** **2D array** `queries` where `queries[i] = [type_i, index_i, val_i]`.

Initially, there is a **0-indexed** `n x n` matrix filled with `0`'s. For each query, you must apply one of the following changes:

	- if `type_i == 0`, set the values in the row with `index_i` to `val_i`, overwriting any previous values.
	- if `type_i == 1`, set the values in the column with `index_i` to `val_i`, overwriting any previous values.

Return *the sum of integers in the matrix after all queries are applied*.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** n = 3, queries = [[0,0,1],[1,2,2],[0,2,3],[1,0,4]]
**Output:** 23
**Explanation:** The image above describes the matrix after each query. The sum of the matrix after all queries are applied is 23.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** n = 3, queries = [[0,0,4],[0,1,2],[1,0,1],[0,2,3],[1,2,1]]
**Output:** 17
**Explanation:** The image above describes the matrix after each query. The sum of the matrix after all queries are applied is 17.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
	- `1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 10^4`
	- `queries[i].length == 3`
	- `0 <= type_i <= 1`
	- `0 <= index_i < n`
	- `0 <= val_i <= 10^5`

## Hints

1. Process queries in reversed order, as the latest queries represent the most recent changes in the matrix.
2. Once you encounter an operation on some row/column, no further operations will affect the values in this row/column. Keep track of seen rows and columns with a set.
3. When operating on an unseen row/column, the number of affected cells is the number of columns/rows you haven’t previously seen.

## Test Cases

```

[[0,0,1],[1,2,2],[0,2,3],[1,0,4]]

[[0,0,4],[0,1,2],[1,0,1],[0,2,3],[1,2,1]]
