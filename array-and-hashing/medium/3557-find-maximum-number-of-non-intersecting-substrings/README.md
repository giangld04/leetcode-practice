## Description

You are given a string `word`.

Return the **maximum** number of non-intersecting **substrings** of word that are at **least** four characters long and start and end with the same letter.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** word = "abcdeafdef"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The two substrings are `"abcdea"` and `"fdef"`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** word = "bcdaaaab"

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

The only substring is `"aaaa"`. Note that we cannot **also** choose `"bcdaaaab"` since it intersects with the other substring.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= word.length <= 2 * 10^5`
	- `word` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Hints

1. Can we solve the problem using Dynamic Programming?
2. For each character c, store all occurrence indices in order
3. At each position i, let j be the first index of word[i]; if i - j >= 3, we can form substring [j, i]
4. For each index, also store the maximum for any substring ending before that index in the dp.

## Test Cases

```
"abcdeafdef"
---
"bcdaaaab"
---
```
