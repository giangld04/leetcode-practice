## Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`, check whether it is possible to divide this array into sets of `k` consecutive numbers.

Return `true` *if it is possible*.** **Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,6], k = 4
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Array can be divided into [1,2,3,4] and [3,4,5,6].
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** nums = [3,2,1,2,3,4,3,4,5,9,10,11], k = 3
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Array can be divided into [1,2,3] , [2,3,4] , [3,4,5] and [9,10,11].
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 3
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Each array should be divided in subarrays of size 3.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

**Note:** This question is the same as 846: https://leetcode.com/problems/hand-of-straights/

## Hints

1. If the smallest number in the possible-to-split array is V, then numbers V+1, V+2, ... V+k-1 must contain there as well.
2. You can iteratively find k sets and remove them from array until it becomes empty.
3. Failure to do so would mean that array is unsplittable.

## Test Cases

```
[1,2,3,3,4,4,5,6]
4

[3,2,1,2,3,4,3,4,5,9,10,11]
3

[1,2,3,4]
