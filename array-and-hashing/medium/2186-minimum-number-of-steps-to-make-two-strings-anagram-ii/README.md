# 2186. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram II

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Hash Table, String, Counting
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-steps-to-make-two-strings-anagram-ii/

## Description

You are given two strings `s` and `t`. In one step, you can append **any character** to either `s` or `t`.

Return *the minimum number of steps to make *`s`* and *`t`* **anagrams** of each other.*

An **anagram** of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** s = "**lee**tco**de**", t = "co**a**t**s**"
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** 
- In 2 steps, we can append the letters in "as" onto s = "leetcode", forming s = "leetcode**as**".
- In 5 steps, we can append the letters in "leede" onto t = "coats", forming t = "coats**leede**".
"leetcodeas" and "coatsleede" are now anagrams of each other.
We used a total of 2 + 5 = 7 steps.
It can be shown that there is no way to make them anagrams of each other with less than 7 steps.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** s = "night", t = "thing"
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The given strings are already anagrams of each other. Thus, we do not need any further steps.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 2 * 10^5`
	- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Hints

1. Notice that for anagrams, the order of the letters is irrelevant.
2. For each letter, we can count its frequency in s and t.
3. For each letter, its contribution to the answer is the absolute difference between its frequency in s and t.

## Test Cases

```
"leetcode"
"coats"
---
"night"
"thing"
---
```
