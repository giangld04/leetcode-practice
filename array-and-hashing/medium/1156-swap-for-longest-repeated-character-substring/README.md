# 1156. Swap For Longest Repeated Character Substring

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Hash Table, String, Sliding Window
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-for-longest-repeated-character-substring/

## Description

You are given a string `text`. You can swap two of the characters in the `text`.

Return *the length of the longest substring with repeated characters*.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** text = "ababa"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We can swap the first 'b' with the last 'a', or the last 'b' with the first 'a'. Then, the longest repeated character substring is "aaa" with length 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** text = "aaabaaa"
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** Swap 'b' with the last 'a' (or the first 'a'), and we get longest repeated character substring "aaaaaa" with length 6.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** text = "aaaaa"
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** No need to swap, longest repeated character substring is "aaaaa" with length is 5.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= text.length <= 2 * 10^4`
	- `text` consist of lowercase English characters only.

## Hints

1. There are two cases:  a block of characters, or two blocks of characters between one different character. 
 By keeping a run-length encoded version of the string, we can easily check these cases.

## Test Cases

```
"ababa"
---
"aaabaaa"
---
"aaaaa"
---
```
