# 3587. Minimum Adjacent Swaps to Alternate Parity

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Greedy
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-adjacent-swaps-to-alternate-parity/

## Description

You are given an array `nums` of **distinct** integers.

In one operation, you can swap any two **adjacent** elements in the array.

An arrangement of the array is considered **valid** if the parity of adjacent elements **alternates**, meaning every pair of neighboring elements consists of one even and one odd number.

Return the **minimum** number of adjacent swaps required to transform `nums` into any valid arrangement.

If it is impossible to rearrange `nums` such that no two adjacent elements have the same parity, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,4,6,5,7]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

Swapping 5 and 6, the array becomes `[2,4,5,6,7]`

Swapping 5 and 4, the array becomes `[2,5,4,6,7]`

Swapping 6 and 7, the array becomes `[2,5,4,7,6]`. The array is now a valid arrangement. Thus, the answer is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,4,5,7]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

By swapping 4 and 5, the array becomes `[2,5,4,7]`, which is a valid arrangement. Thus, the answer is 1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

The array is already a valid arrangement. Thus, no operations are needed.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** nums = [4,5,6,8]

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:**

No valid arrangement is possible. Thus, the answer is -1.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
	- All elements in `nums` are **distinct**.

## Hints

1. Compute evenCnt and oddCnt in nums. If abs(evenCnt - oddCnt) > 1, return -1 immediately.
2. Let n = len(nums). You’ll try at most two target parity‐patterns: one starting with even at index 0, one with odd at index 0.
3. If n is odd, only the pattern whose starting parity matches the larger of evenCnt or oddCnt is feasible. If n is even, both starting‐even and starting‐odd patterns are possible—compute both and take the minimum.
4. For a given target pattern, collect the indices of all even elements in nums (or odd elements) and the indices where an even (or odd) should go in the pattern.
5. The minimum adjacent‐swap cost to align those elements is the sum of absolute differences between each element’s current index and its target index.
6. Return the smallest cost over valid patterns.
