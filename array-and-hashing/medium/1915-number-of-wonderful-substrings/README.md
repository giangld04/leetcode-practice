## Description

A **wonderful** string is a string where **at most one** letter appears an **odd** number of times.



	- For example, `"ccjjc"` and `"abab"` are wonderful, but `"ab"` is not.



Given a string `word` that consists of the first ten lowercase English letters (`'a'` through `'j'`), return *the **number of wonderful non-empty substrings** in *`word`*. If the same substring appears multiple times in *`word`*, then count **each occurrence** separately.*



A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.




**Example 1:**



```
**Input:** word = "aba"
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The four wonderful substrings are underlined below:
- "**a**ba" -> "a"
- "a**b**a" -> "b"
- "ab**a**" -> "a"
- "**aba**" -> "aba"
```



**Example 2:**



```
**Input:** word = "aabb"
**Output:** 9
**Explanation:** The nine wonderful substrings are underlined below:
- "**a**abb" -> "a"
- "**aa**bb" -> "aa"
- "**aab**b" -> "aab"
- "**aabb**" -> "aabb"
- "a**a**bb" -> "a"
- "a**abb**" -> "abb"
- "aa**b**b" -> "b"
- "aa**bb**" -> "bb"
- "aab**b**" -> "b"
```



**Example 3:**



```
**Input:** word = "he"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The two wonderful substrings are underlined below:
- "he" -> "h"
- "h**e**" -> "e"
```




**Constraints:**



	- `1 <= word.length <= 10^5`
	- `word` consists of lowercase English letters from `'a'` to `'j'`.

## Hints

1. For each prefix of the string, check which characters are of even frequency and which are not and represent it by a bitmask.
2. Find the other prefixes whose masks differs from the current prefix mask by at most one bit.

## Test Cases

```
"aba"
---
"aabb"
---
"he"
---
```
