# 2401. Longest Nice Subarray

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Bit Manipulation, Sliding Window
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-nice-subarray/

## Description

You are given an array `nums` consisting of **positive** integers.

We call a subarray of `nums` **nice** if the bitwise **AND** of every pair of elements that are in **different** positions in the subarray is equal to `0`.

Return *the length of the **longest** nice subarray*.

A **subarray** is a **contiguous** part of an array.

**Note** that subarrays of length `1` are always considered nice.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** nums = [1,3,8,48,10]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The longest nice subarray is [3,8,48]. This subarray satisfies the conditions:
- 3 AND 8 = 0.
- 3 AND 48 = 0.
- 8 AND 48 = 0.
It can be proven that no longer nice subarray can be obtained, so we return 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** nums = [3,1,5,11,13]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The length of the longest nice subarray is 1. Any subarray of length 1 can be chosen.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Hints

1. What is the maximum possible length of a nice subarray?
2. If two numbers have bitwise AND equal to zero, they do not have any common set bit. A number x 9 only has 30 bits, hence the length of the longest nice subarray cannot exceed 30.

## Test Cases

```
[1,3,8,48,10]
---
[3,1,5,11,13]

```
