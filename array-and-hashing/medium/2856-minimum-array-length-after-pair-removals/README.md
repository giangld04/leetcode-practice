## Description

Given an integer array `num` sorted in non-decreasing order.

You can perform the following operation any number of times:

	- Choose **two** indices, `i` and `j`, where `nums[i] < nums[j]`.
	- Then, remove the elements at indices `i` and `j` from `nums`. The remaining elements retain their original order, and the array is re-indexed.

Return the **minimum** length of `nums` after applying the operation zero or more times.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,1,2,2,3,3]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1000000000,1000000000]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

Since both numbers are equal, they cannot be removed.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** nums = [2,3,4,4,4]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
	- `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

## Hints

1. To minimize the length of the array, we should maximize the number of operations performed.
2. To perform k operations, it is optimal to use the smallest k values and the largest k values in nums.
3. What is the best way to make pairs from the smallest k values and the largest k values so it is possible to remove all the pairs?
4. If we consider the smallest k values and the largest k values as two separate sorted 0-indexed arrays, a and b, It is optimal to pair a[i] and b[i]. So, a k is valid if a[i]  for all i in the range [0, k - 1].
5. The greatest possible valid k can be found using binary search.
6. The answer is nums.length - 2 * k.
