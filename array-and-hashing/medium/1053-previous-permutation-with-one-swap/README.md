# 1053. Previous Permutation With One Swap

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Greedy
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/previous-permutation-with-one-swap/

## Description

Given an array of positive integers `arr` (not necessarily distinct), return *the **lexicographically** largest permutation that is smaller than* `arr`, that can be **made with exactly one swap**. If it cannot be done, then return the same array.

**Note** that a *swap* exchanges the positions of two numbers `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** arr = [3,2,1]
**Output:** [3,1,2]
**Explanation:** Swapping 2 and 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** arr = [1,1,5]
**Output:** [1,1,5]
**Explanation:** This is already the smallest permutation.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** arr = [1,9,4,6,7]
**Output:** [1,7,4,6,9]
**Explanation:** Swapping 9 and 7.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^4`
	- `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^4`

## Hints

1. You need to swap two values, one larger than the other.  Where is the larger one located?

## Test Cases

```
[3,2,1]
---
[1,1,5]
---
[1,9,4,6,7]
---
```
