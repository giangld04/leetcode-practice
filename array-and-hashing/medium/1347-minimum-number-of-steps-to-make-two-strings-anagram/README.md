# 1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Hash Table, String, Counting
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-steps-to-make-two-strings-anagram/

## Description

You are given two strings of the same length `s` and `t`. In one step you can choose **any character** of `t` and replace it with **another character**.

Return *the minimum number of steps* to make `t` an anagram of `s`.

An **Anagram** of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** s = "bab", t = "aba"
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** Replace the first 'a' in t with b, t = "bba" which is anagram of s.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** s = "leetcode", t = "practice"
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Replace 'p', 'r', 'a', 'i' and 'c' from t with proper characters to make t anagram of s.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** s = "anagram", t = "mangaar"
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** "anagram" and "mangaar" are anagrams.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
	- `s.length == t.length`
	- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters only.

## Hints

1. Count the frequency of characters of each string.
2. Loop over all characters if the frequency of a character in t is less than the frequency of the same character in s then add the difference between the frequencies to the answer.

## Test Cases

```
"bab"
"aba"

"leetcode"
"practice"

"anagram"
"mangaar"
