## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

A **subarray** is called **balanced** if the number of **distinct even** numbers in the subarray is equal to the number of **distinct odd** numbers.

Return the length of the **longest** balanced subarray.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,5,4,3]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

	- The longest balanced subarray is `[2, 5, 4, 3]`.
	- It has 2 distinct even numbers `[2, 4]` and 2 distinct odd numbers `[5, 3]`. Thus, the answer is 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,2,2,5,4]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

	- The longest balanced subarray is `[3, 2, 2, 5, 4]`.
	- It has 2 distinct even numbers `[2, 4]` and 2 distinct odd numbers `[3, 5]`. Thus, the answer is 5.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,2]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

	- The longest balanced subarray is `[2, 3, 2]`.
	- It has 1 distinct even number `[2]` and 1 distinct odd number `[3]`. Thus, the answer is 3.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 1500`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## Hints

1. Use brute force
2. Try every subarray and use a map/set data structure to track the distinct even and odd numbers

## Test Cases
