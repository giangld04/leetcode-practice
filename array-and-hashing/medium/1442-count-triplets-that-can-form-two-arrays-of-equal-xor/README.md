## Description

Given an array of integers `arr`.

We want to select three indices `i`, `j` and `k` where `(0 <= i < j <= k < arr.length)`.

Let's define `a` and `b` as follows:

	- `a = arr[i] ^ arr[i + 1] ^ ... ^ arr[j - 1]`
	- `b = arr[j] ^ arr[j + 1] ^ ... ^ arr[k]`

Note that **^** denotes the **bitwise-xor** operation.

Return *the number of triplets* (`i`, `j` and `k`) Where `a == b`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** arr = [2,3,1,6,7]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The triplets are (0,1,2), (0,2,2), (2,3,4) and (2,4,4)
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** arr = [1,1,1,1,1]
**Output:** 10
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= arr.length <= 300`
	- `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^8`

## Hints

1. We are searching for sub-array of length ≥ 2 and we need to split it to 2 non-empty arrays so that the xor of the first array is equal to the xor of the second array. This is equivalent to searching for sub-array with xor = 0.
2. Keep the prefix xor of arr in another array, check the xor of all sub-arrays in O(n^2), if the xor of sub-array of length x is 0 add x-1 to the answer.

## Test Cases

```
[2,3,1,6,7]

[1,1,1,1,1]
