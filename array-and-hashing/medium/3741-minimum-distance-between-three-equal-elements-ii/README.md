## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

A tuple `(i, j, k)` of 3 **distinct** indices is **good** if `nums[i] == nums[j] == nums[k]`.

The **distance** of a **good** tuple is `abs(i - j) + abs(j - k) + abs(k - i)`, where `abs(x)` denotes the **absolute value** of `x`.

Return an integer denoting the **minimum** possible **distance** of a **good** tuple. If no **good** tuples exist, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,1,1,3]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

The minimum distance is achieved by the good tuple `(0, 2, 3)`.

`(0, 2, 3)` is a good tuple because `nums[0] == nums[2] == nums[3] == 1`. Its distance is `abs(0 - 2) + abs(2 - 3) + abs(3 - 0) = 2 + 1 + 3 = 6`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,1,2,3,2,1,2]

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:**

The minimum distance is achieved by the good tuple `(2, 4, 6)`.

`(2, 4, 6)` is a good tuple because `nums[2] == nums[4] == nums[6] == 2`. Its distance is `abs(2 - 4) + abs(4 - 6) + abs(6 - 2) = 2 + 2 + 4 = 8`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1]

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:**

There are no good tuples. Therefore, the answer is -1.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n == nums.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`

## Hints

1. The distance formula abs(i - j) + abs(j - k) + abs(k - i) simplifies to 2 * (max(i, j, k) - min(i, j, k)).
2. Group the indices for each unique number. For a number to form a good tuple, it must appear at least 3 times.
3. For each number that appears at least 3 times, we want to find three of its indices p  that minimize r - p. This is achieved by considering every three consecutive indices in the sorted list of indices.

## Test Cases
