## Description

You are given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `target`.

You have to find **two non-overlapping sub-arrays** of `arr` each with a sum equal `target`. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is **minimum**.

Return *the minimum sum of the lengths* of the two required sub-arrays, or return `-1` if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 ([3] and [3]). The sum of their lengths is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 ([7], [3,4] and [7]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as the sum of their lengths is 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** arr = [4,3,2,6,2,3,4], target = 6
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** We have only one sub-array of sum = 6.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
	- `1 <= target <= 10^8`

## Hints

1. Let's create two arrays prefix and suffix where prefix[i] is the minimum length of sub-array ends before i and has sum = k, suffix[i] is the minimum length of sub-array starting at or after i and has sum = k.
2. The answer we are searching for is min(prefix[i] + suffix[i]) for all values of i from 0 to n-1 where n == arr.length.
3. If you are still stuck with how to build prefix and suffix, you can store for each index i the length of the sub-array starts at i and has sum = k or infinity otherwise, and you can use it to build both prefix and suffix.
