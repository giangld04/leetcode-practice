# 3659. Partition Array Into K-Distinct Groups

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Hash Table, Counting
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-into-k-distinct-groups/

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to partition all elements of `nums` into one or more groups such that:

	- Each group contains **exactly** `k` elements.
	- All elements in each group are **distinct**.
	- Each element in `nums` must be assigned to **exactly** one group.

Return `true` if such a partition is possible, otherwise return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 2

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

One possible partition is to have 2 groups:

	- Group 1: `[1, 2]`
	- Group 2: `[3, 4]`

Each group contains `k = 2` distinct elements, and all elements are used exactly once.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,5,2,2], k = 2

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

One possible partition is to have 2 groups:

	- Group 1: `[2, 3]`
	- Group 2: `[2, 5]`

Each group contains `k = 2` distinct elements, and all elements are used exactly once.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,5,2,3], k = 3

**Output:** false

**Explanation:**

We cannot form groups of `k = 3` distinct elements using all values exactly once.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
	- `^​​​​​​​1 <= k <= nums.length`

## Hints

1. Think about how many groups of size k you need to form.
2. Each group must contain exactly k distinct elements.
3. If any element appears more times than the number of groups groups, it cannot be placed uniquely in each group.
4. Use a frequency map freq to count the occurrences of each element.
5. If the total number of elements n is not divisible by k, partitioning is impossible.

## Test Cases
