# 3176. Find the Maximum Length of a Good Subsequence I

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Hash Table, Dynamic Programming
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-length-of-a-good-subsequence-i/

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and a **non-negative** integer `k`. A sequence of integers `seq` is called **good** if there are **at most** `k` indices `i` in the range `[0, seq.length - 2]` such that `seq[i] != seq[i + 1]`.

Return the **maximum** possible length of a **good** subsequence of `nums`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,1,1,3], k = 2

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

The maximum length subsequence is `[1,2,1,1,3]`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5,1], k = 0

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The maximum length subsequence is `[1,2,3,4,5,1]`.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 500`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
	- `0 <= k <= min(nums.length, 25)`

## Hints

1. The absolute values in nums don’t really matter. So we can remap the set of values to the range [0, n - 1].
2. Let dp[i][j] be the length of the longest subsequence till index j with at most i positions such that seq[i] != seq[i + 1].
3. For each value x from left to right, update dp[i][x] = max(dp[i][x] + 1, dp[i - 1][y] + 1), where y != x.

## Test Cases

```
[1,2,1,1,3]
2

[1,2,3,4,5,1]
