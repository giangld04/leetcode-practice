## Description

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed and is protected by a security system with a color code.

You are given two integer arrays `nums` and `colors`, both of length `n`, where `nums[i]` is the amount of money in the `i^th` house and `colors[i]` is the color code of that house.

You **cannot rob two adjacent** houses if they share the **same color** code.

Return the **maximum** amount of money you can rob.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,4,3,5], colors = [1,1,2,2]

**Output:** 9

**Explanation:**

	- Choose houses `i = 1` with `nums[1] = 4` and `i = 3` with `nums[3] = 5` because they are non-adjacent.
	- Thus, the total amount robbed is `4 + 5 = 9`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,1,2,4], colors = [2,3,2,2]

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:**

	- Choose houses `i = 0` with `nums[0] = 3`, `i = 1` with `nums[1] = 1`, and `i = 3` with `nums[3] = 4`.
	- This selection is valid because houses `i = 0` and `i = 1` have different colors, and house `i = 3` is non-adjacent to `i = 1`.
	- Thus, the total amount robbed is `3 + 1 + 4 = 8`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [10,1,3,9], colors = [1,1,1,2]

**Output:** 22

**Explanation:**

	- Choose houses `i = 0` with `nums[0] = 10`, `i = 2` with `nums[2] = 3`, and `i = 3` with `nums[3] = 9`.
	- This selection is valid because houses `i = 0` and `i = 2` are non-adjacent, and houses `i = 2` and `i = 3` have different colors.
	- Thus, the total amount robbed is `10 + 3 + 9 = 22`.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n == nums.length == colors.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums[i], colors[i] <= 10^5`

## Hints

1. Use dynamic programming
2. Let dp[i] be the maximum money robbable considering houses up to index i
3. Initialize dp[i] with nums[i], then compare with skipping the house: dp[i - 1]
4. If colors[i] != colors[i - 1], allow taking adjacent house: nums[i] + dp[i - 1]
5. Always allow non-adjacent take: nums[i] + dp[i - 2]
6. Answer is dp[n - 1]
