## Description

You are given a string `s` that consists of lowercase English letters.

A string is called **special** if it is made up of only a single character. For example, the string `"abc"` is not special, whereas the strings `"ddd"`, `"zz"`, and `"f"` are special.

Return *the length of the **longest special substring** of *`s` *which occurs **at least thrice***, *or *`-1`* if no special substring occurs at least thrice*.

A **substring** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** s = "aaaa"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The longest special substring which occurs thrice is "aa": substrings "**aa**aa", "a**aa**a", and "aa**aa**".
It can be shown that the maximum length achievable is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** s = "abcdef"
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There exists no special substring which occurs at least thrice. Hence return -1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** s = "abcaba"
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The longest special substring which occurs thrice is "a": substrings "**a**bcaba", "abc**a**ba", and "abcab**a**".
It can be shown that the maximum length achievable is 1.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `3 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^5`
	- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

## Hints

1. Let len[i] be the length of the longest special string ending with s[i].
2. If i > 0 and s[i] == s[i - 1], len[i] = len[i - 1] + 1. Otherwise len[i] == 1.
3. Group all the len[i] by s[i]. We have at most 26 groups.
4. The maximum value of the third largest len[i] in each group is the answer.
5. We only need to maintain the top three values for each group. You can use sorting, heap, or brute-force comparison to find the third largest value in each group.

## Test Cases

```
"aaaa"
---
"abcdef"
---
"abcaba"
---
```
