# 229. Majority Element II

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Hash Table, Sorting, Counting
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element-ii/

## Description

Given an integer array of size `n`, find all elements that appear more than `⌊ n/3 ⌋` times.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** nums = [3,2,3]
**Output:** [3]
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** nums = [1]
**Output:** [1]
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** nums = [1,2]
**Output:** [1,2]
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^4`
	- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

**Follow up:** Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space?

## Hints

1. Think about the possible number of elements that can appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times in the array.
2. It can be at most two. Why?
3. Consider using Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, which is efficient for finding elements that appear more than a certain threshold.

## Test Cases

```
[3,2,3]
---
[1]
---
[1,2]

```
