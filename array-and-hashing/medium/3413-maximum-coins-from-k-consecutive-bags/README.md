# 3413. Maximum Coins From K Consecutive Bags

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Binary Search, Greedy, Sliding Window, Sorting, Prefix Sum
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-coins-from-k-consecutive-bags/

## Description

There are an infinite amount of bags on a number line, one bag for each coordinate. Some of these bags contain coins.

You are given a 2D array `coins`, where `coins[i] = [l_i, r_i, c_i]` denotes that every bag from `l_i` to `r_i` contains `c_i` coins.

The segments that `coins` contain are non-overlapping.

You are also given an integer `k`.

Return the **maximum** amount of coins you can obtain by collecting `k` consecutive bags.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** coins = [[8,10,1],[1,3,2],[5,6,4]], k = 4

**Output:** 10

**Explanation:**

Selecting bags at positions `[3, 4, 5, 6]` gives the maximum number of coins: `2 + 0 + 4 + 4 = 10`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** coins = [[1,10,3]], k = 2

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

Selecting bags at positions `[1, 2]` gives the maximum number of coins: `3 + 3 = 6`.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= coins.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= k <= 10^9`
	- `coins[i] == [l_i, r_i, c_i]`
	- `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= 10^9`
	- `1 <= c_i <= 1000`
	- The given segments are non-overlapping.

## Hints

1. An optimal starting position for k consecutive bags will be either li or ri - k + 1.

## Test Cases

```
[[8,10,1],[1,3,2],[5,6,4]]
4
