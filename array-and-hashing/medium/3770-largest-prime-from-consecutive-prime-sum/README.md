# 3770. Largest Prime from Consecutive Prime Sum

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Math, Number Theory
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-prime-from-consecutive-prime-sum/

## Description

You are given an integer `n`.

Return the **largest prime number** less than or equal to `n` that can be expressed as the **sum** of one or more **consecutive prime numbers** starting from 2. If no such number exists, return 0.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 20

**Output:** 17

**Explanation:**

The prime numbers less than or equal to `n = 20` which are consecutive prime sums are:

	- 
`2 = 2`

	
	- 
`5 = 2 + 3`

	
	- 
`17 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7`

	

The largest is 17, so it is the answer.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The only consecutive prime sum less than or equal to 2 is 2 itself.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5`

## Hints

1. Generate all prime numbers up to n (use sieve or trial division).
2. Compute consecutive sums starting from 2 until the sum exceeds n.
3. Find the largest sum that is also a prime.
