# 2536. Increment Submatrices by One

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Matrix, Prefix Sum
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/increment-submatrices-by-one/

## Description

You are given a positive integer `n`, indicating that we initially have an `n x n` **0-indexed** integer matrix `mat` filled with zeroes.

You are also given a 2D integer array `query`. For each `query[i] = [row1_i, col1_i, row2_i, col2_i]`, you should do the following operation:

	- Add `1` to **every element** in the submatrix with the **top left** corner `(row1_i, col1_i)` and the **bottom right** corner `(row2_i, col2_i)`. That is, add `1` to `mat[x][y]` for all `row1_i <= x <= row2_i` and `col1_i <= y <= col2_i`.

Return* the matrix* `mat`* after performing every query.*

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** n = 3, queries = [[1,1,2,2],[0,0,1,1]]
**Output:** [[1,1,0],[1,2,1],[0,1,1]]
**Explanation:** The diagram above shows the initial matrix, the matrix after the first query, and the matrix after the second query.
- In the first query, we add 1 to every element in the submatrix with the top left corner (1, 1) and bottom right corner (2, 2).
- In the second query, we add 1 to every element in the submatrix with the top left corner (0, 0) and bottom right corner (1, 1).
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** n = 2, queries = [[0,0,1,1]]
**Output:** [[1,1],[1,1]]
**Explanation:** The diagram above shows the initial matrix and the matrix after the first query.
- In the first query we add 1 to every element in the matrix.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 500`
	- `1 <= queries.length <= 10^4`
	- `0 <= row1_i <= row2_i < n`
	- `0 <= col1_i <= col2_i < n`

## Hints

1. Imagine each row as a separate array. Instead of updating the whole submatrix together, we can use prefix sum to update each row separately.
2. For each query, iterate over the rows i in the range [row1, row2] and add 1 to prefix sum S[i][col1], and subtract 1 from S[i][col2 + 1].
3. After doing this operation for all the queries, update each row separately with S[i][j] = S[i][j] + S[i][j - 1].

## Test Cases

```
3
[[1,1,2,2],[0,0,1,1]]

2
[[0,0,1,1]]
