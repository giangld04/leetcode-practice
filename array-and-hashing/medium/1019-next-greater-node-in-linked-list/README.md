# 1019. Next Greater Node In Linked List

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Linked List, Stack, Monotonic Stack
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-node-in-linked-list/

## Description

You are given the `head` of a linked list with `n` nodes.

For each node in the list, find the value of the **next greater node**. That is, for each node, find the value of the first node that is next to it and has a **strictly larger** value than it.

Return an integer array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the value of the next greater node of the `i^th` node (**1-indexed**). If the `i^th` node does not have a next greater node, set `answer[i] = 0`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** head = [2,1,5]
**Output:** [5,5,0]
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** head = [2,7,4,3,5]
**Output:** [7,0,5,5,0]
```

**Constraints:**

	- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
	- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
	- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^9`

## Hints

1. We can use a stack that stores nodes in monotone decreasing order of value.  When we see a node_j with a larger value, every node_i in the stack has next_larger(node_i) = node_j .

## Test Cases

```
[2,1,5]
---
[2,7,4,3,5]
---
```
