# 1016. Binary String With Substrings Representing 1 To N

**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-string-with-substrings-representing-1-to-n/

## Description

Given a binary string `s` and a positive integer `n`, return `true`* if the binary representation of all the integers in the range *`[1, n]`* are **substrings** of *`s`*, or *`false`* otherwise*.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** s = "0110", n = 3
**Output:** true
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** s = "0110", n = 4
**Output:** false
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
	- `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
	- `1 <= n <= 10^9`

## Hints

1. We only need to check substrings of length at most 30, because 10^9 has 30 bits.

## Test Cases

```
"0110"
3
---
"0110"
4
---
```
