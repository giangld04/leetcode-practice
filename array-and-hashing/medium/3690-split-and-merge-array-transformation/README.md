## Description

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, each of length `n`. You may perform the following **split-and-merge operation** on `nums1` any number of times:

	- Choose a subarray `nums1[L..R]`.
	- Remove that subarray, leaving the prefix `nums1[0..L-1]` (empty if `L = 0`) and the suffix `nums1[R+1..n-1]` (empty if `R = n - 1`).
	- Re-insert the removed subarray (in its original order) at **any** position in the remaining array (i.e., between any two elements, at the very start, or at the very end).

Return the **minimum** number of **split-and-merge operations** needed to transform `nums1` into `nums2`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = [3,1,2], nums2 = [1,2,3]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

	- Split out the subarray `[3]` (`L = 0`, `R = 0`); the remaining array is `[1,2]`.
	- Insert `[3]` at the end; the array becomes `[1,2,3]`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = [1,1,2,3,4,5], nums2 = [5,4,3,2,1,1]

**Output: **3

**Explanation:**

	- Remove `[1,1,2]` at indices `0 - 2`; remaining is `[3,4,5]`; insert `[1,1,2]` at position `2`, resulting in `[3,4,1,1,2,5]`.
	- Remove `[4,1,1]` at indices `1 - 3`; remaining is `[3,2,5]`; insert `[4,1,1]` at position `3`, resulting in `[3,2,5,4,1,1]`.
	- Remove `[3,2]` at indices `0 - 1`; remaining is `[5,4,1,1]`; insert `[3,2]` at position `2`, resulting in `[5,4,3,2,1,1]`.

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= n == nums1.length == nums2.length <= 6`
	- `-10^5 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^5`
	- `nums2` is a **permutation** of `nums1`.

## Hints

1. Use BFS over the space of array states, starting from nums1 and aiming for nums2.
2. Represent each state as an array (or tuple) and enqueue it alongside its current operation count.
3. Maintain a visited set (e.g. a hash set or dictionary keyed by the state) to avoid revisiting the same configuration.
4. For each dequeued state, generate all possible "split-and-merge" successors by choosing every valid subarray [L..R], removing it, and inserting it at every possible position.
5. Stop as soon as you dequeue nums2, and return its associated operation count.

## Test Cases
