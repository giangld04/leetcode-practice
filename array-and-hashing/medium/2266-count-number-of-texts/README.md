# 2266. Count Number of Texts

## Description

Alice is texting Bob using her phone. The **mapping** of digits to letters is shown in the figure below.

In order to **add** a letter, Alice has to **press** the key of the corresponding digit `i` times, where `i` is the position of the letter in the key.

	- For example, to add the letter `'s'`, Alice has to press `'7'` four times. Similarly, to add the letter `'k'`, Alice has to press `'5'` twice.
	- Note that the digits `'0'` and `'1'` do not map to any letters, so Alice **does not** use them.

However, due to an error in transmission, Bob did not receive Alice's text message but received a **string of pressed keys** instead.

	- For example, when Alice sent the message `"bob"`, Bob received the string `"2266622"`.

Given a string `pressedKeys` representing the string received by Bob, return *the **total number of possible text messages** Alice could have sent*.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** pressedKeys = "22233"
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:**
The possible text messages Alice could have sent are:
"aaadd", "abdd", "badd", "cdd", "aaae", "abe", "bae", and "ce".
Since there are 8 possible messages, we return 8.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** pressedKeys = "222222222222222222222222222222222222"
**Output:** 82876089
**Explanation:**
There are 2082876103 possible text messages Alice could have sent.
Since we need to return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7, we return 2082876103 % (10^9 + 7) = 82876089.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= pressedKeys.length <= 10^5`
	- `pressedKeys` only consists of digits from `'2'` - `'9'`.

## Hints

1. For a substring consisting of the same digit, how can we count the number of texts it could have originally represented?
2. How can dynamic programming help us calculate the required answer?
