# 3652. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock using Strategy

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Sliding Window, Prefix Sum
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-using-strategy/

## Description

You are given two integer arrays `prices` and `strategy`, where:

	- `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i^th` day.
	- `strategy[i]` represents a trading action on the `i^th` day, where:
	
		- `-1` indicates buying one unit of the stock.
		- `0` indicates holding the stock.
		- `1` indicates selling one unit of the stock.
	
	

You are also given an **even** integer `k`, and may perform **at most one** modification to `strategy`. A modification consists of:

	- Selecting exactly `k` **consecutive** elements in `strategy`.
	- Set the **first** `k / 2` elements to `0` (hold).
	- Set the **last** `k / 2` elements to `1` (sell).

The **profit** is defined as the **sum** of `strategy[i] * prices[i]` across all days.

Return the **maximum** possible profit you can achieve.

**Note:** There are no constraints on budget or stock ownership, so all buy and sell operations are feasible regardless of past actions.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = [4,2,8], strategy = [-1,0,1], k = 2

**Output:** 10

**Explanation:**

	
		
			Modification
			Strategy
			Profit Calculation
			Profit
		
	
	
		
			Original
			[-1, 0, 1]
			(-1 × 4) + (0 × 2) + (1 × 8) = -4 + 0 + 8
			4
		
		
			Modify [0, 1]
			[0, 1, 1]
			(0 × 4) + (1 × 2) + (1 × 8) = 0 + 2 + 8
			10
		
		
			Modify [1, 2]
			[-1, 0, 1]
			(-1 × 4) + (0 × 2) + (1 × 8) = -4 + 0 + 8
			4
		
	

Thus, the maximum possible profit is 10, which is achieved by modifying the subarray `[0, 1]`​​​​​​​.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = [5,4,3], strategy = [1,1,0], k = 2

**Output:** 9

**Explanation:**

	
		
			Modification
			Strategy
			Profit Calculation
			Profit
		
	
	
		
			Original
			[1, 1, 0]
			(1 × 5) + (1 × 4) + (0 × 3) = 5 + 4 + 0
			9
		
		
			Modify [0, 1]
			[0, 1, 0]
			(0 × 5) + (1 × 4) + (0 × 3) = 0 + 4 + 0
			4
		
		
			Modify [1, 2]
			[1, 0, 1]
			(1 × 5) + (0 × 4) + (1 × 3) = 5 + 0 + 3
			8
		
	

Thus, the maximum possible profit is 9, which is achieved without any modification.

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= prices.length == strategy.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= prices[i] <= 10^5`
	- `-1 <= strategy[i] <= 1`
	- `2 <= k <= prices.length`
	- `k` is even

## Hints

1. Use prefix sums to precompute the base profit and to get fast range queries (sums of prices and counts of each strategy value over any interval).
2. Try every segment of length k: compute the profit delta caused by replacing that segment (using the prefix queries) and take the maximum of base + delta.
