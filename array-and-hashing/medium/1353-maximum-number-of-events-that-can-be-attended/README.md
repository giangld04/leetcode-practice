# 1353. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Greedy, Sorting, Heap (Priority Queue)
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended/

## Description

You are given an array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDay_i, endDay_i]`. Every event `i` starts at `startDay_i`_ and ends at `endDay_i`.

You can attend an event `i` at any day `d` where `startDay_i <= d <= endDay_i`. You can only attend one event at any time `d`.

Return *the maximum number of events you can attend*.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** You can attend all the three events.
One way to attend them all is as shown.
Attend the first event on day 1.
Attend the second event on day 2.
Attend the third event on day 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** events= [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]
**Output:** 4
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= events.length <= 10^5`
	- `events[i].length == 2`
	- `1 <= startDay_i <= endDay_i <= 10^5`

## Hints

1. Sort the events by the start time and in case of tie by the end time in ascending order.
2. Loop over the sorted events. Attend as much as you can and keep the last day occupied. When you try to attend new event keep in mind the first day you can attend a new event in.

## Test Cases

```
[[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]

[[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]
