# 1171. Remove Zero Sum Consecutive Nodes from Linked List

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Hash Table, Linked List
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-zero-sum-consecutive-nodes-from-linked-list/

## Description

Given the `head` of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to `0` until there are no such sequences.



After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.  You may return any such answer.


(Note that in the examples below, all sequences are serializations of `ListNode` objects.)

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** head = [1,2,-3,3,1]
**Output:** [3,1]
**Note:** The answer [1,2,1] would also be accepted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** head = [1,2,3,-3,4]
**Output:** [1,2,4]
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** head = [1,2,3,-3,-2]
**Output:** [1]
```

**Constraints:**

	- The given linked list will contain between `1` and `1000` nodes.
	- Each node in the linked list has `-1000 <= node.val <= 1000`.

## Hints

1. Convert the linked list into an array.
2. While you can find a non-empty subarray with sum = 0, erase it.
3. Convert the array into a linked list.

## Test Cases

```
[1,2,-3,3,1]
---
[1,2,3,-3,4]
---
[1,2,3,-3,-2]
---
```
