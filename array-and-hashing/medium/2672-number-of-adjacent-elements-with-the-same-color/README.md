# 2672. Number of Adjacent Elements With the Same Color

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-adjacent-elements-with-the-same-color/

## Description

You are given an integer `n` representing an array `colors` of length `n` where all elements are set to 0's meaning **uncolored**. You are also given a 2D integer array `queries` where `queries[i] = [index_i, color_i]`. For the `i^th` **query**:

	- Set `colors[index_i]` to `color_i`.
	- Count the number of adjacent pairs in `colors` which have the same color (regardless of `color_i`).

Return an array `answer` of the same length as `queries` where `answer[i]` is the answer to the `i^th` query.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, queries = [[0,2],[1,2],[3,1],[1,1],[2,1]]

**Output:** [0,1,1,0,2]

**Explanation:**

	- Initially array colors = [0,0,0,0], where 0 denotes uncolored elements of the array.
	- After the 1^st query colors = [2,0,0,0]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 0.
	- After the 2^nd query colors = [2,2,0,0]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 1.
	- After the 3^rd query colors = [2,2,0,1]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 1.
	- After the 4^th query colors = [2,1,0,1]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 0.
	- After the 5^th query colors = [2,1,1,1]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1, queries = [[0,100000]]

**Output:** [0]

**Explanation:**

After the 1^st query colors = [100000]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 0.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
	- `queries[i].length == 2`
	- `0 <= index_i <= n - 1`
	- `1 <=  color_i <= 10^5`

## Hints

1. Since at each query, only one element is being recolored, we just need to focus on its neighbors.
2. If an element that is changed on the i-th query had the same color as its right element answer decreases by 1. Similarly contributes its left element too.
3. After changing the color, if the element has the same color as its right element answer increases by 1. Similarly contributes its left element too.

## Test Cases
