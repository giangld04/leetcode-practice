# 3914. Minimum Operations to Make Array Non Decreasing

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Greedy
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-array-non-decreasing/

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.

In one operation, you may choose any **subarray** `nums[l..r]` and **increase** each element in that **subarray** by `x`, where `x` is any **positive** integer.

Return the **minimum** possible **sum** of the values of `x` across all operations required to make the array **non-decreasing**.

An array is **non-decreasing** if `nums[i] <= nums[i + 1]` for all `0 <= i < n - 1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [3,3,2,1]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

One optimal set of operations:

	- Choose subarray `[2..3]` and add `x = 1` resulting in `[3, 3, 3, 2]`
	- Choose subarray `[3..3]` and add `x = 1` resulting in `[3, 3, 3, 3]`

The array becomes non-decreasing, and the total sum of chosen `x` values is `1 + 1 = 2`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [5,1,2,3]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

One optimal set of operations:

	- Choose subarray `[1..3]` and add `x = 4` resulting in `[5, 5, 6, 7]`

The array becomes non-decreasing, and the total sum of chosen `x` values is `4`.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n == nums.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Hints

1. Focus only on positions where the array decreases (nums[i] > nums[i + 1]).
2. Each such drop must be fixed by increasing a subarray starting at i + 1.
3. Observe that you only need to pay for the difference at each drop.

## Test Cases

```
[3,3,2,1]
---
[5,1,2,3]

```
