## Description

Given a string `s`, return *the maximum number of unique substrings that the given string can be split into*.

You can split string `s` into any list of **non-empty substrings**, where the concatenation of the substrings forms the original string. However, you must split the substrings such that all of them are **unique**.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** s = "ababccc"
**Output:** 5
**Explanation**: One way to split maximally is ['a', 'b', 'ab', 'c', 'cc']. Splitting like ['a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'cc'] is not valid as you have 'a' and 'b' multiple times.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** s = "aba"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation**: One way to split maximally is ['a', 'ba'].
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** s = "aa"
**Output:** 1
**Explanation**: It is impossible to split the string any further.
```

**Constraints:**

	- 
`1 <= s.length <= 16`

	
	- 
`s` contains only lower case English letters.

## Hints

1. Use a set to keep track of which substrings have been used already
2. Try each possible substring at every position and backtrack if a complete split is not possible

## Test Cases

```
"ababccc"
---
"aba"
---
"aa"
---
```
