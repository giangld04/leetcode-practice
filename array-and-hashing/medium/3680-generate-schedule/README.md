# 3680. Generate Schedule

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Math, Greedy
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-schedule/

## Description

You are given an integer `n` representing `n` teams. You are asked to generate a schedule such that:

	- Each team plays every other team **exactly twice**: once at home and once away.
	- There is **exactly one** match per day; the schedule is a list of **consecutive** days and `schedule[i]` is the match on day `i`.
	- No team plays on **consecutive** days.

Return a 2D integer array `schedule`, where `schedule[i][0]` represents the home team and `schedule[i][1]` represents the away team. If multiple schedules meet the conditions, return **any** one of them.

If no schedule exists that meets the conditions, return an empty array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3

**Output:** []

**Explanation:**

​​​​​​​Since each team plays every other team exactly twice, a total of 6 matches need to be played: `[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[1,0],[2,0],[2,1]`.

It's not possible to create a schedule without at least one team playing consecutive days.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5

**Output:** [[0,1],[2,3],[0,4],[1,2],[3,4],[0,2],[1,3],[2,4],[0,3],[1,4],[2,0],[3,1],[4,0],[2,1],[4,3],[1,0],[3,2],[4,1],[3,0],[4,2]]

**Explanation:**

Since each team plays every other team exactly twice, a total of 20 matches need to be played.

The output shows one of the schedules that meet the conditions. No team plays on consecutive days.

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= n <= 50`​​​​​​​

## Hints

1. The problem can be solved greedily or using randomization.
2. Try pairing teams greedily while ensuring neither team played on the previous day.
3. Keep track of how many games each team still has to play.
4. Among teams that didn't play the previous day, match a pair whose combined remaining games is highest.
5. If a greedy choice leads to a dead end, try a different match order.
