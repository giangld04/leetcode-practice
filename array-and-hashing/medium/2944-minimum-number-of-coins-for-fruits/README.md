**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-coins-for-fruits/

## Description

You are given an **0-indexed** integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` denotes the number of coins needed to purchase the `(i + 1)^th` fruit.

The fruit market has the following reward for each fruit:

	- If you purchase the `(i + 1)^th` fruit at `prices[i]` coins, you can get any number of the next `i` fruits for free.

**Note** that even if you **can** take fruit `j` for free, you can still purchase it for `prices[j - 1]` coins to receive its reward.

Return the **minimum** number of coins needed to acquire all the fruits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = [3,1,2]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

	- Purchase the 1^st fruit with `prices[0] = 3` coins, you are allowed to take the 2^nd fruit for free.
	- Purchase the 2^nd fruit with `prices[1] = 1` coin, you are allowed to take the 3^rd fruit for free.
	- Take the 3^rd fruit for free.

Note that even though you could take the 2^nd fruit for free as a reward of buying 1^st fruit, you purchase it to receive its reward, which is more optimal.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = [1,10,1,1]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

	- Purchase the 1^st fruit with `prices[0] = 1` coin, you are allowed to take the 2^nd fruit for free.
	- Take the 2^nd fruit for free.
	- Purchase the 3^rd fruit for `prices[2] = 1` coin, you are allowed to take the 4^th fruit for free.
	- Take the 4^t^h fruit for free.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** prices = [26,18,6,12,49,7,45,45]

**Output:** 39

**Explanation:**

	- Purchase the 1^st fruit with `prices[0] = 26` coin, you are allowed to take the 2^nd fruit for free.
	- Take the 2^nd fruit for free.
	- Purchase the 3^rd fruit for `prices[2] = 6` coin, you are allowed to take the 4^th, 5^th and 6^th (the next three) fruits for free.
	- Take the 4^t^h fruit for free.
	- Take the 5^t^h fruit for free.
	- Purchase the 6^th fruit with `prices[5] = 7` coin, you are allowed to take the 8^th and 9^th fruit for free.
	- Take the 7^t^h fruit for free.
	- Take the 8^t^h fruit for free.

Note that even though you could take the 6^th fruit for free as a reward of buying 3^rd fruit, you purchase it to receive its reward, which is more optimal.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= prices.length <= 1000`
	- `1 <= prices[i] <= 10^5`

## Hints

1. The intended solution uses Dynamic Programming.
2. Let dp[i] denote the minimum number of coins, such that we bought ith fruit and acquired all the fruits in the range [i...n].
3. dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + prices[i]) , where j is in the range [i + 1, i + 1 + i].
