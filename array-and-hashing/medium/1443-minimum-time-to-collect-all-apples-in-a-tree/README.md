## Description

Given an undirected tree consisting of `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n-1`, which has some apples in their vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over one edge of the tree. *Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend to collect all apples in the tree, starting at **vertex 0** and coming back to this vertex.*

The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` means that exists an edge connecting the vertices `a_i` and `b_i`. Additionally, there is a boolean array `hasApple`, where `hasApple[i] = true` means that vertex `i` has an apple; otherwise, it does not have any apple.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,true,false,true,true,false]
**Output:** 8 
**Explanation:** The figure above represents the given tree where red vertices have an apple. One optimal path to collect all apples is shown by the green arrows.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,true,false,false,true,false]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The figure above represents the given tree where red vertices have an apple. One optimal path to collect all apples is shown by the green arrows.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,false,false,false,false,false]
**Output:** 0
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
	- `edges.length == n - 1`
	- `edges[i].length == 2`
	- `0 <= a_i < b_i <= n - 1`
	- `hasApple.length == n`

## Hints

1. Note that if a node u contains an apple then all edges in the path from the root to the node u have to be used forward and backward (2 times).
2. Therefore use a depth-first search (DFS) to check if an edge will be used or not.

## Test Cases
