# 3702. Longest Subsequence With Non-Zero Bitwise XOR

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Bit Manipulation
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subsequence-with-non-zero-bitwise-xor/

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

Return the length of the **longest subsequence** in `nums` whose bitwise **XOR** is **non-zero**. If no such **subsequence** exists, return 0.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

One longest subsequence is `[2, 3]`. The bitwise XOR is computed as `2 XOR 3 = 1`, which is non-zero.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,3,4]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

The longest subsequence is `[2, 3, 4]`. The bitwise XOR is computed as `2 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 5`, which is non-zero.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
	- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Hints

1. What happens if you take the entire array?
2. If the XOR of the entire array is 0, can removing one element help?
3. What if all elements are 0?

## Test Cases

```
[1,2,3]
---
[2,3,4]
