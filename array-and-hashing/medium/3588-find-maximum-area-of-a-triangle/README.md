## Description

You are given a 2D array `coords` of size `n x 2`, representing the coordinates of `n` points in an infinite Cartesian plane.

Find **twice** the **maximum** area of a triangle with its corners at *any* three elements from `coords`, such that at least one side of this triangle is **parallel** to the x-axis or y-axis. Formally, if the maximum area of such a triangle is `A`, return `2 * A`.

If no such triangle exists, return -1.

**Note** that a triangle *cannot* have zero area.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** coords = [[1,1],[1,2],[3,2],[3,3]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The triangle shown in the image has a base 1 and height 2. Hence its area is `1/2 * base * height = 1`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** coords = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:**

The only possible triangle has corners `(1, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, and `(3, 3)`. None of its sides are parallel to the x-axis or the y-axis.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n == coords.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= coords[i][0], coords[i][1] <= 10^6`
	- All `coords[i]` are **unique**.

## Hints

1. area * 2 = base * height
2. Let the base be parallel to the x‑axis or y‑axis
3. Sort to find the maximum base for each fixed x (or y), then the maximum height comes from the extreme values of the other coordinate.

## Test Cases

```
[[1,1],[1,2],[3,2],[3,3]]

[[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
