# 3843. First Element with Unique Frequency

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Hash Table, Counting
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/first-element-with-unique-frequency/

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

Return an integer denoting the **first** element (scanning from left to right) in `nums` whose **frequency** is **unique**. That is, no other integer appears the same number of times in `nums`. If there is no such element, return -1.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [20,10,30,30]

**Output:** 30

**Explanation:**

	- 20 appears once.
	- 10 appears once.
	- 30 appears twice.
	- The frequency of 30 is unique because no other integer appears exactly twice.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [20,20,10,30,30,30]

**Output:** 20

**Explanation:**

	- 20 appears twice.
	- 10 appears once.
	- 30 appears 3 times.
	- The frequency of 20, 10, and 30 are unique. The first element that has unique frequency is 20.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [10,10,20,20]

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:**

	- 10 appears twice.
	- 20 appears twice.
	- No element has a unique frequency.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## Hints

1. Use two hash maps: one freq and one freqCount
2. First pass: for each x in nums do freq[x] += 1
3. Build counts of frequencies: for each f in values of freq do freqCount[f] += 1
4. Scan nums from left to right and return the first x with freqCount[freq[x]] == 1; return -1 if none
