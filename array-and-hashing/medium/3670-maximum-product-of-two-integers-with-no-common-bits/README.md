## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

Your task is to find two **distinct** indices `i` and `j` such that the product `nums[i] * nums[j]` is **maximized,** and the binary representations of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` do not share any common set bits.

Return the **maximum** possible product of such a pair. If no such pair exists, return 0.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

**Output:** 12

**Explanation:**

The best pair is 3 (011) and 4 (100). They share no set bits and `3 * 4 = 12`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [5,6,4]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

Every pair of numbers has at least one common set bit. Hence, the answer is 0.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [64,8,32]

**Output:** 2048

**Explanation:**

No pair of numbers share a common bit, so the answer is the product of the two maximum elements, 64 and 32 (`64 * 32 = 2048`).

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`

## Hints

1. Think of each number as a mask: treat nums[i] as a bitmask.
2. Create an array dp of size 1 , where B is your bit‑width.
3. Initialize dp[mask] to the maximum nums[i] exactly equal to that mask, or 0 if none.
4. For each m, propagate to all its super‑masks M: dp[m] = max(dp[m], dp[M])
5. For a number x with mask mx, compute its "complement mask" as cm = ~mx & ((1 .
6. The best disjoint partner is then dp[cm].
7. Loop over all x in nums, look up dp[cm], and track the maximum x * partner.
