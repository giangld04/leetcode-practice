## Description

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `n`.

You can perform the following two operations any number of times on these two arrays:

	- **Swap within the same array**: Choose two indices `i` and `j`. Then, choose either to swap `nums1[i]` and `nums1[j]`, or `nums2[i]` and `nums2[j]`. This operation is **free of charge**.
	- **Swap between two arrays**: Choose an index `i`. Then, swap `nums1[i]` and `nums2[i]`. This operation **incurs a cost of 1**.

Return an integer denoting the **minimum cost** to make `nums1` and `nums2` **identical**. If this is not possible, return -1.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = [10,20], nums2 = [20,10]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

	- Swap `nums2[0] = 20` and `nums2[1] = 10`.

	
		- `nums2` becomes `[10, 20]`.
		- This operation is free of charge.
	
	
	- `nums1` and `nums2` are now identical. The cost is 0.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = [10,10], nums2 = [20,20]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

	- Swap `nums1[0] = 10` and `nums2[0] = 20`.

	
		- `nums1` becomes `[20, 10]`.
		- `nums2` becomes `[10, 20]`.
		- This operation costs 1.
	
	
	- Swap `nums2[0] = 10` and `nums2[1] = 20`.
	
		- `nums2` becomes `[20, 10]`.
		- This operation is free of charge.
	
	
	- `nums1` and `nums2` are now identical. The cost is 1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums1 = [10,20], nums2 = [30,40]

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:**

It is impossible to make the two arrays identical. Therefore, the answer is -1.

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= n == nums1.length == nums2.length <= 8 * 10^4`
	- `1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 8 * 10^4`

## Hints

1. Since swaps inside the same array are free, positions do not matter; only frequencies matter.
2. Let cnt1[v] and cnt2[v] be frequencies. If cnt1[v] + cnt2[v] is odd for any v, return -1.
3. Let diff[v] = abs(cnt1[v] - cnt2[v]). Each cross swap fixes two mismatches, so minimum cost = sum(diff[v]) / 4.
