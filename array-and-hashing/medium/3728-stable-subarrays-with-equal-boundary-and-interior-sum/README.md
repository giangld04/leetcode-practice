# 3728. Stable Subarrays With Equal Boundary and Interior Sum

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Hash Table, Prefix Sum
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/stable-subarrays-with-equal-boundary-and-interior-sum/

## Description

You are given an integer array `capacity`.

A subarray `capacity[l..r]` is considered **stable** if:

	- Its length is **at least** 3.
	- The **first** and **last** elements are each equal to the **sum** of all elements **strictly between** them (i.e., `capacity[l] = capacity[r] = capacity[l + 1] + capacity[l + 2] + ... + capacity[r - 1]`).

Return an integer denoting the number of **stable subarrays**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** capacity = [9,3,3,3,9]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

	- `[9,3,3,3,9]` is stable because the first and last elements are both 9, and the sum of the elements strictly between them is `3 + 3 + 3 = 9`.
	- `[3,3,3]` is stable because the first and last elements are both 3, and the sum of the elements strictly between them is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** capacity = [1,2,3,4,5]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

No subarray of length at least 3 has equal first and last elements, so the answer is 0.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** capacity = [-4,4,0,0,-8,-4]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

`[-4,4,0,0,-8,-4]` is stable because the first and last elements are both -4, and the sum of the elements strictly between them is `4 + 0 + 0 + (-8) = -4`

**Constraints:**

	- `3 <= capacity.length <= 10^5`
	- `-10^9 <= capacity[i] <= 10^9`

## Hints

1. Use prefix sums
2. Let the prefix sum array be p; notice that for a stable range [l, r], the condition becomes p[r - 1] - p[l] == a[r] and a[l] == a[r]
3. For each index r, you want to count the number of previous indices l such that p[l] == p[r - 1] - a[r] and a[l] == a[r]
4. You can do this efficiently by maintaining a map from (a[i], p[i]) to a frequency count as you iterate

## Test Cases

```
[9,3,3,3,9]

[1,2,3,4,5]
