# 3900. Longest Balanced Substring After One Swap

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Hash Table, String, Prefix Sum
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-balanced-substring-after-one-swap/

## Description

You are given a binary string `s` consisting only of characters `'0'` and `'1'`.

A string is **balanced** if it contains an **equal** number of `'0'`s and `'1'`s.

You can perform **at most one** swap between any two characters in `s`. Then, you select a **balanced** substring from `s`.

Return an integer representing the **maximum** length of the **balanced** substring you can select.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "100001"

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

	- Swap `"10**0**00**1**"`. The string becomes `"101000"`.
	- Select the substring `"**1010**00"`, which is balanced because it has two `'0'`s and two `'1'`s.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "111"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

	- Choose not to perform any swaps.
	- Select the empty substring, which is balanced because it has zero `'0'`s and zero `'1'`s.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
	- `s` consists only of the characters `'0'` and `'1'`.

## Hints

1. A balanced substring has the same number of 0s and 1s.
2. Even after one swap, the answer cannot exceed 2 * min(cnt0, cnt1).
3. The swap is only useful if it can improve one chosen window.
4. Look for a substring whose balance can be fixed by moving one mismatched character in or out.
5. Track prefix balance and check how far a valid segment can extend after one swap.
