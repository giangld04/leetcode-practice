# 3767. Maximize Points After Choosing K Tasks

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Greedy, Sorting, Heap (Priority Queue)
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-points-after-choosing-k-tasks/

## Description

You are given two integer arrays, `technique1` and `technique2`, each of length `n`, where `n` represents the number of tasks to complete.

	- If the `i^th` task is completed using technique 1, you earn `technique1[i]` points.
	- If it is completed using technique 2, you earn `technique2[i]` points.

You are also given an integer `k`, representing the **minimum** number of tasks that **must** be completed using technique 1.

You **must** complete **at least** `k` tasks using technique 1 (they do not need to be the first `k` tasks).

The remaining tasks may be completed using **either** technique.

Return an integer denoting the **maximum total points** you can earn.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** technique1 = [5,2,10], technique2 = [10,3,8], k = 2

**Output:** 22

**Explanation:**

We must complete at least `k = 2` tasks using `technique1`.

Choosing `technique1[1]` and `technique1[2]` (completed using technique 1), and `technique2[0]` (completed using technique 2), yields the maximum points: `2 + 10 + 10 = 22`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** technique1 = [10,20,30], technique2 = [5,15,25], k = 2

**Output:** 60

**Explanation:**

We must complete at least `k = 2` tasks using `technique1`.

Choosing all tasks using technique 1 yields the maximum points: `10 + 20 + 30 = 60`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** technique1 = [1,2,3], technique2 = [4,5,6], k = 0

**Output:** 15

**Explanation:**

Since `k = 0`, we are not required to choose any task using `technique1`.

Choosing all tasks using technique 2 yields the maximum points: `4 + 5 + 6 = 15`.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n == technique1.length == technique2.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= technique1[i], technique2​​​​​​​[i] <= 10^​​​​​​​5`
	- `0 <= k <= n`

## Hints

1. Initially complete all tasks using way 1; let the initial total be sum(reward1).
2. The delta when switching task i from way 1 to way 2 is reward2[i] - reward1[i].
3. Sort deltas descending and apply the largest n - k; after each switch update the maximum.
