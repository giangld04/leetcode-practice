# 3952. Maximum Total Value of Covered Indices

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, String, Dynamic Programming, Greedy
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-total-value-of-covered-indices/

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and a binary string `s` of length `n`, where `s[i] == '1'` means index `i` initially contains a **token** and `s[i] == '0'` means it does not.

You may perform the following operation any number of times:

	- Choose a token currently located at index `i`, where `i > 0`, such that this token has **not** been moved before.
	- Move this token from index `i` to index `i - 1`.

An index is considered **covered** if it contains a token after all moves.

Return an integer denoting the **maximum total value** of `nums` at the covered indices after optimally performing the operations.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [9,2,6,1], s = "0101"

**Output:** 15

**Explanation:**

	- Initially, indices 1 and 3 contain tokens.
	- Move the token from index 3 to index 2.
	- Move the token from index 1 to index 0.
	- The covered indices are `[0, 2]`, so the total value is `nums[0] + nums[2] = 9 + 6 = 15`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [5,1,4], s = "001"

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

	- Initially, only index 2 contains a token.
	- It is optimal to leave the token at index 2.
	- The covered index is `[2]`, so the total value is `nums[2] = 4`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [9,3,5], s = "011"

**Output:** 14

**Explanation:**

	- Initially, indices 1 and 2 contain tokens.
	- Move the token from index 1 to index 0.
	- The covered indices are `[0, 2]`, so the total value is `nums[0] + nums[2] = 9 + 5 = 14`.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n == nums.length == s.length <= 10^5`
	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
	- ​​​​​​​`s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`

## Hints

1. 1a (Greedy). Consider each maximal block of consecutive tokens independently, together with the index immediately before the block if it exists.
2. 1b (Greedy). From this range, every index except one can be covered, so subtract the minimum nums value in the range.
3. 2a (DP). A token at index i can only end at i or i - 1.
4. 2b (DP). Process indices from left to right and keep whether the previous index is already covered; try both choices for the current token when possible.

## Test Cases

```
[9,2,6,1]
"0101"
---
[5,1,4]
"001"
---
[9,3,5]
"011"
