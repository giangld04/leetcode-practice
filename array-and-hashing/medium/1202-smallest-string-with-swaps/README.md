# 1202. Smallest String With Swaps

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Hash Table, String, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Union-Find, Sorting
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-string-with-swaps/

## Description

You are given a string `s`, and an array of pairs of indices in the string `pairs` where `pairs[i] = [a, b]` indicates 2 indices(0-indexed) of the string.

You can swap the characters at any pair of indices in the given `pairs` **any number of times**.

Return the lexicographically smallest string that `s` can be changed to after using the swaps.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** s = "dcab", pairs = [[0,3],[1,2]]
**Output:** "bacd"
**Explaination:** 
Swap s[0] and s[3], s = "bcad"
Swap s[1] and s[2], s = "bacd"
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** s = "dcab", pairs = [[0,3],[1,2],[0,2]]
**Output:** "abcd"
**Explaination: **
Swap s[0] and s[3], s = "bcad"
Swap s[0] and s[2], s = "acbd"
Swap s[1] and s[2], s = "abcd"
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** s = "cba", pairs = [[0,1],[1,2]]
**Output:** "abc"
**Explaination: **
Swap s[0] and s[1], s = "bca"
Swap s[1] and s[2], s = "bac"
Swap s[0] and s[1], s = "abc"
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
	- `0 <= pairs.length <= 10^5`
	- `0 <= pairs[i][0], pairs[i][1] < s.length`
	- `s` only contains lower case English letters.

## Hints

1. Think of it as a graph problem.
2. Consider the pairs as connected nodes in the graph, what can you do with a connected component of indices ?
3. We can sort each connected component alone to get the lexicographically minimum string.

## Test Cases

```
"dcab"
[[0,3],[1,2]]
---
"dcab"
[[0,3],[1,2],[0,2]]
---
"cba"
[[0,1],[1,2]]
---
```
