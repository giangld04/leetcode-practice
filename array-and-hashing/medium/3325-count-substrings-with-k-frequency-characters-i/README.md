# 3325. Count Substrings With K-Frequency Characters I

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Hash Table, String, Sliding Window
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-substrings-with-k-frequency-characters-i/

## Description

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return the total number of substrings of `s` where **at least one** character appears **at least** `k` times.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abacb", k = 2

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

The valid substrings are:

	- `"aba"` (character `'a'` appears 2 times).
	- `"abac"` (character `'a'` appears 2 times).
	- `"abacb"` (character `'a'` appears 2 times).
	- `"bacb"` (character `'b'` appears 2 times).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "abcde", k = 1

**Output:** 15

**Explanation:**

All substrings are valid because every character appears at least once.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 3000`
	- `1 <= k <= s.length`
	- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Hints

1. Fix the left index of the substring.
2. For the fixed left index, find the first right index for which substring s[left..right] satisfies the condition.
3. Every substring that starts at left and ends after right satisfies the condition.

## Test Cases

```
"abacb"
2
---
"abcde"
1
---
```
