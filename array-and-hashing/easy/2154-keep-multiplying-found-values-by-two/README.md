# 2154. Keep Multiplying Found Values by Two

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Tags:** Array, Hash Table, Sorting, Simulation
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/keep-multiplying-found-values-by-two/

## Description

You are given an array of integers `nums`. You are also given an integer `original` which is the first number that needs to be searched for in `nums`.

You then do the following steps:

	- If `original` is found in `nums`, **multiply** it by two (i.e., set `original = 2 * original`).
	- Otherwise, **stop** the process.
	- **Repeat** this process with the new number as long as you keep finding the number.

Return *the **final** value of *`original`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** nums = [5,3,6,1,12], original = 3
**Output:** 24
**Explanation:** 
- 3 is found in nums. 3 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 6.
- 6 is found in nums. 6 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 12.
- 12 is found in nums. 12 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 24.
- 24 is not found in nums. Thus, 24 is returned.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** nums = [2,7,9], original = 4
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:**
- 4 is not found in nums. Thus, 4 is returned.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
	- `1 <= nums[i], original <= 1000`

## Hints

1. Repeatedly iterate through the array and check if the current value of original is in the array.
2. If original is not found, stop and return its current value.
3. Otherwise, multiply original by 2 and repeat the process.
4. Use set data structure to check the existence faster.

## Test Cases
