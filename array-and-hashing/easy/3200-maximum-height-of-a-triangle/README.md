# 3200. Maximum Height of a Triangle

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Tags:** Array, Enumeration
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-height-of-a-triangle/

## Description

You are given two integers `red` and `blue` representing the count of red and blue colored balls. You have to arrange these balls to form a triangle such that the 1^st row will have 1 ball, the 2^nd row will have 2 balls, the 3^rd row will have 3 balls, and so on.

All the balls in a particular row should be the **same** color, and adjacent rows should have **different** colors.

Return the **maximum*** height of the triangle* that can be achieved.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** red = 2, blue = 4

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

The only possible arrangement is shown above.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** red = 2, blue = 1

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The only possible arrangement is shown above.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** red = 1, blue = 1

**Output:** 1

**Example 4:**

**Input:** red = 10, blue = 1

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The only possible arrangement is shown above.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= red, blue <= 100`

## Hints

1. Count the max height using both possibilities. That is, red ball as top and blue ball as top.
2. For counting the max height, use a simple for loop and remove the number of balls required at this level.
