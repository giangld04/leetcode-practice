## Description

Given a string `s`, return `true`* if *`s`* is a **good** string, or *`false`* otherwise*.

A string `s` is **good** if **all** the characters that appear in `s` have the **same** number of occurrences (i.e., the same frequency).

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** s = "abacbc"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The characters that appear in s are 'a', 'b', and 'c'. All characters occur 2 times in s.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** s = "aaabb"
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The characters that appear in s are 'a' and 'b'.
'a' occurs 3 times while 'b' occurs 2 times, which is not the same number of times.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
	- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Hints

1. Build a dictionary containing the frequency of each character appearing in s
2. Check if all values in the dictionary are the same.

## Test Cases

```
"abacbc"
---
"aaabb"

```
