# 3745. Maximize Expression of Three Elements

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Tags:** Array, Greedy, Sorting, Enumeration
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-expression-of-three-elements/

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

Choose three elements `a`, `b`, and `c` from `nums` at **distinct** indices such that the value of the expression `a + b - c` is maximized.

Return an integer denoting the **maximum possible value** of this expression.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,4,2,5]

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:**

We can choose `a = 4`, `b = 5`, and `c = 1`. The expression value is `4 + 5 - 1 = 8`, which is the maximum possible.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [-2,0,5,-2,4]

**Output:** 11

**Explanation:**

We can choose `a = 5`, `b = 4`, and `c = -2`. The expression value is `5 + 4 - (-2) = 11`, which is the maximum possible.

**Constraints:**

	- `3 <= nums.length <= 100`
	- `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Hints

1. a and b should be the two largest values in nums
2. c should be the smallest value in nums

## Test Cases

```
[1,4,2,5]
---
[-2,0,5,-2,4]

```
