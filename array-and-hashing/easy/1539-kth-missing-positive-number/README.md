# 1539. Kth Missing Positive Number

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Tags:** Array, Binary Search
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-missing-positive-number/

## Description

Given an array `arr` of positive integers sorted in a **strictly increasing order**, and an integer `k`.

Return *the* `k^th` ***positive** integer that is **missing** from this array.*

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
**Output:** 9
**Explanation: **The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5^th missing positive integer is 9.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
**Output:** 6
**Explanation: **The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2^nd missing positive integer is 6.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
	- `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
	- `1 <= k <= 1000`
	- `arr[i] < arr[j]` for `1 <= i < j <= arr.length`

**Follow up:**

Could you solve this problem in less than O(n) complexity?

## Hints

1. Keep track of how many positive numbers are missing as you scan the array.

## Test Cases

```
[2,3,4,7,11]
5
