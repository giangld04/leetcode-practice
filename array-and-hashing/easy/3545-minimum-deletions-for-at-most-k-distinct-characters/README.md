## Description

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, and an integer `k`.

Your task is to delete some (possibly none) of the characters in the string so that the number of **distinct** characters in the resulting string is **at most** `k`.

Return the **minimum** number of deletions required to achieve this.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abc", k = 2

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

	- `s` has three distinct characters: `'a'`, `'b'` and `'c'`, each with a frequency of 1.
	- Since we can have at most `k = 2` distinct characters, remove all occurrences of any one character from the string.
	- For example, removing all occurrences of `'c'` results in at most `k` distinct characters. Thus, the answer is 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "aabb", k = 2

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

	- `s` has two distinct characters (`'a'` and `'b'`) with frequencies of 2 and 2, respectively.
	- Since we can have at most `k = 2` distinct characters, no deletions are required. Thus, the answer is 0.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "yyyzz", k = 1

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

	- `s` has two distinct characters (`'y'` and `'z'`) with frequencies of 3 and 2, respectively.
	- Since we can have at most `k = 1` distinct character, remove all occurrences of any one character from the string.
	- Removing all `'z'` results in at most `k` distinct characters. Thus, the answer is 2.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 16`
	- `1 <= k <= 16`
	- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Hints

1. Compute the frequency of each character in s and collect these into a list counts.
2. Sort counts in ascending order.
3. Let d = (number of distinct characters) – k. If d , return 0.
4. Otherwise, the minimum deletions is the sum of the first d entries in counts (removing the d least-frequent characters).

## Test Cases

```
"abc"
2
---
"aabb"
2

"yyyzz"
