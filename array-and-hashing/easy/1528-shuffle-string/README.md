# 1528. Shuffle String

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Tags:** Array, String
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/shuffle-string/

## Description

You are given a string `s` and an integer array `indices` of the **same length**. The string `s` will be shuffled such that the character at the `i^th` position moves to `indices[i]` in the shuffled string.

Return *the shuffled string*.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** s = "codeleet", `indices` = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
**Output:** "leetcode"
**Explanation:** As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** s = "abc", `indices` = [0,1,2]
**Output:** "abc"
**Explanation:** After shuffling, each character remains in its position.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `s.length == indices.length == n`
	- `1 <= n <= 100`
	- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
	- `0 <= indices[i] < n`
	- All values of `indices` are **unique**.

## Hints

1. You can create an auxiliary string t of length n.
2. Assign t[indexes[i]] to s[i] for each i from 0 to n-1.

## Test Cases

```
"codeleet"
[4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
---
"abc"
[0,1,2]
---
```
