# 3936. Minimum Swaps to Move Zeros to End

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Tags:** Array, Two Pointers
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-swaps-to-move-zeros-to-end/

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

In one operation, you can choose any two **distinct** indices `i` and `j` and swap `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`.

Return an integer denoting the **minimum** number of operations required to move all 0s to the end of the array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [0,1,0,3,12]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

We perform the following swap operations:

	- Swap `nums[0]` and `nums[3]`, giving `nums = [3, 1, 0, 0, 12]`.
	- Swap `nums[2]` and `nums[4]`, giving `nums = [3, 1, 12, 0, 0]`.

Thus, the answer is 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [0,1,0,2]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

We perform the following swap operations:

	- Swap `nums[0]` and `nums[3]`, giving `nums = [2, 1, 0, 0]`.

Thus, the answer is 1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,0]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

The array already satisfies the condition. Therefore, no swap operations are needed.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
	- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Hints

1. The values of non-zero elements do not matter.
Convert the array to zeros and ones.
2. All ones that are in positions where a zero should be must be swapped out.

## Test Cases

```
[0,1,0,3,12]
---
[0,1,0,2]
