## Description

A **pangram** is a sentence where every letter of the English alphabet appears at least once.

Given a string `sentence` containing only lowercase English letters, return* *`true`* if *`sentence`* is a **pangram**, or *`false`* otherwise.*

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** sentence = "thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** sentence contains at least one of every letter of the English alphabet.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** sentence = "leetcode"
**Output:** false
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= sentence.length <= 1000`
	- `sentence` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Hints

1. Iterate over the string and mark each character as found (using a boolean array, bitmask, or any other similar way).
2. Check if the number of found characters equals the alphabet length.
