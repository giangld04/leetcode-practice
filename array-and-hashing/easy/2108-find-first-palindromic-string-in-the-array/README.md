# 2108. Find First Palindromic String in the Array

## Description

Given an array of strings `words`, return *the first **palindromic** string in the array*. If there is no such string, return *an **empty string** *`""`.

A string is **palindromic** if it reads the same forward and backward.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
**Output:** "ada"
**Explanation:** The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** words = ["notapalindrome","racecar"]
**Output:** "racecar"
**Explanation:** The first and only string that is palindromic is "racecar".
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** words = ["def","ghi"]
**Output:** ""
**Explanation:** There are no palindromic strings, so the empty string is returned.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
	- `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
	- `words[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Hints

1. Iterate through the elements in order. As soon as the current element is a palindrome, return it.
2. To check if an element is a palindrome, can you reverse the string?

## Test Cases

```
["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
---
["notapalindrome","racecar"]
---
["def","ghi"]
---
```
