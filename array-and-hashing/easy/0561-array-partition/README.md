## Description

Given an integer array `nums` of `2n` integers, group these integers into `n` pairs `(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), ..., (a_n, b_n)` such that the sum of `min(a_i, b_i)` for all `i` is **maximized**. Return* the maximized sum*.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** nums = [1,4,3,2]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** All possible pairings (ignoring the ordering of elements) are:
1. (1, 4), (2, 3) -> min(1, 4) + min(2, 3) = 1 + 2 = 3
2. (1, 3), (2, 4) -> min(1, 3) + min(2, 4) = 1 + 2 = 3
3. (1, 2), (3, 4) -> min(1, 2) + min(3, 4) = 1 + 3 = 4
So the maximum possible sum is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** nums = [6,2,6,5,1,2]
**Output:** 9
**Explanation:** The optimal pairing is (2, 1), (2, 5), (6, 6). min(2, 1) + min(2, 5) + min(6, 6) = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
	- `nums.length == 2 * n`
	- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

## Hints

1. Obviously, brute force won't help here. Think of something else, take some example like 1,2,3,4.
2. How will you make pairs to get the result? There must be some pattern.
3. Did you observe that- Minimum element gets add into the result in sacrifice of maximum element.
4. Still won't able to find pairs? Sort the array and try to find the pattern.

## Test Cases

```
[1,4,3,2]
---
[6,2,6,5,1,2]

```
