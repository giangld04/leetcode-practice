**Difficulty:** Easy
**Tags:** Array, String, String Matching
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-words-with-a-given-prefix/

## Description

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `pref`.

Return *the number of strings in *`words`* that contain *`pref`* as a **prefix***.

A **prefix** of a string `s` is any leading contiguous substring of `s`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** words = ["pay","**at**tention","practice","**at**tend"], `pref `= "at"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The 2 strings that contain "at" as a prefix are: "**at**tention" and "**at**tend".
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** words = ["leetcode","win","loops","success"], `pref `= "code"
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There are no strings that contain "code" as a prefix.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
	- `1 <= words[i].length, pref.length <= 100`
	- `words[i]` and `pref` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Hints

1. Go through each word in words and increment the answer if pref is a prefix of the word.

## Test Cases

```
["pay","attention","practice","attend"]
"at"
---
["leetcode","win","loops","success"]
"code"
---
```
