**Difficulty:** Easy
**Tags:** Array
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/element-appearing-more-than-25-in-sorted-array/

## Description

Given an integer array **sorted** in non-decreasing order, there is exactly one integer in the array that occurs more than 25% of the time, return that integer.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** arr = [1,2,2,6,6,6,6,7,10]
**Output:** 6
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** arr = [1,1]
**Output:** 1
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^4`
	- `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^5`

## Hints

1. Divide the array in four parts [1 - 25%] [25 - 50 %] [50 - 75 %] [75% - 100%]
2. The answer should be in one of the ends of the intervals.
3. In order to check which is element is the answer we can count the frequency with binarySearch.

## Test Cases

```
[1,2,2,6,6,6,6,7,10]
---
[1,1]
---
```
