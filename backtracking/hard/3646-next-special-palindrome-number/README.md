# 3646. Next Special Palindrome Number

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** Backtracking, Bit Manipulation
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/next-special-palindrome-number/

## Description

You are given an integer `n`.

A number is called **special** if:

	- It is a **palindrome**.
	- Every digit `k` in the number appears **exactly** `k` times.

Return the **smallest** special number **strictly **greater than `n`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2

**Output:** 22

**Explanation:**

22 is the smallest special number greater than 2, as it is a palindrome and the digit 2 appears exactly 2 times.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 33

**Output:** 212

**Explanation:**

212 is the smallest special number greater than 33, as it is a palindrome and the digits 1 and 2 appear exactly 1 and 2 times respectively.

 

**Constraints:**

	- `0 <= n <= 10^15`

## Hints

1. There are only a few special numbers; preprocess them.
2. Use bitmasking to brute‑force all valid selections of digits k for the number.
3. Generate all permutations of the first half of the digits, then mirror them to form the full palindrome.
4. For each n, use binary search to find the smallest special number strictly greater than n.
