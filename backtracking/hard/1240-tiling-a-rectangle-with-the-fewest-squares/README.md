# 1240. Tiling a Rectangle with the Fewest Squares

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** Backtracking
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/tiling-a-rectangle-with-the-fewest-squares/

## Description

Given a rectangle of size `n` x `m`, return *the minimum number of integer-sided squares that tile the rectangle*.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** n = 2, m = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** `3` squares are necessary to cover the rectangle.
`2` (squares of `1x1`)
`1` (square of `2x2`)
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** n = 5, m = 8
**Output:** 5
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** n = 11, m = 13
**Output:** 6
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n, m <= 13`

## Hints

1. Can you use backtracking to solve this problem ?.
2. Suppose you've placed a bunch of squares. Where is the natural spot to place the next square ?.
3. The maximum number of squares to be placed will be ≤ max(n,m).
