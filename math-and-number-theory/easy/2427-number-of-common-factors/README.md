# 2427. Number of Common Factors

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Tags:** Math, Enumeration, Number Theory
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-common-factors/

## Description

Given two positive integers `a` and `b`, return *the number of **common** factors of *`a`* and *`b`.

An integer `x` is a **common factor** of `a` and `b` if `x` divides both `a` and `b`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** a = 12, b = 6
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The common factors of 12 and 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** a = 25, b = 30
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The common factors of 25 and 30 are 1, 5.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= a, b <= 1000`

## Hints

1. For each integer in range [1,1000], check if it’s divisible by both A and B.

## Test Cases

```
