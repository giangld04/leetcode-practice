# 1154. Day of the Year

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Tags:** Math, String
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/day-of-the-year/

## Description

Given a string `date` representing a Gregorian calendar date formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`, return *the day number of the year*.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** date = "2019-01-09"
**Output:** 9
**Explanation:** Given date is the 9th day of the year in 2019.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** date = "2019-02-10"
**Output:** 41
```

**Constraints:**

	- `date.length == 10`
	- `date[4] == date[7] == '-'`, and all other `date[i]`'s are digits
	- `date` represents a calendar date between Jan 1^st, 1900 and Dec 31^st, 2019.

## Hints

1. Have a integer array of how many days there are per month.  February gets one extra day if its a leap year.  Then, we can manually count the ordinal as day + (number of days in months before this one).

## Test Cases

```
"2019-01-09"

"2019-02-10"
