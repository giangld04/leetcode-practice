# 1860. Incremental Memory Leak

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Math, Simulation
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/incremental-memory-leak/

## Description

You are given two integers `memory1` and `memory2` representing the available memory in bits on two memory sticks. There is currently a faulty program running that consumes an increasing amount of memory every second.

At the `i^th` second (starting from 1), `i` bits of memory are allocated to the stick with **more available memory** (or from the first memory stick if both have the same available memory). If neither stick has at least `i` bits of available memory, the program **crashes**.

Return *an array containing *`[crashTime, memory1_crash, memory2_crash]`*, where *`crashTime`* is the time (in seconds) when the program crashed and *`memory1_crash`* and *`memory2_crash`* are the available bits of memory in the first and second sticks respectively*.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** memory1 = 2, memory2 = 2
**Output:** [3,1,0]
**Explanation:** The memory is allocated as follows:
- At the 1^st second, 1 bit of memory is allocated to stick 1. The first stick now has 1 bit of available memory.
- At the 2^nd second, 2 bits of memory are allocated to stick 2. The second stick now has 0 bits of available memory.
- At the 3^rd second, the program crashes. The sticks have 1 and 0 bits available respectively.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** memory1 = 8, memory2 = 11
**Output:** [6,0,4]
**Explanation:** The memory is allocated as follows:
- At the 1^st second, 1 bit of memory is allocated to stick 2. The second stick now has 10 bit of available memory.
- At the 2^nd second, 2 bits of memory are allocated to stick 2. The second stick now has 8 bits of available memory.
- At the 3^rd second, 3 bits of memory are allocated to stick 1. The first stick now has 5 bits of available memory.
- At the 4^th second, 4 bits of memory are allocated to stick 2. The second stick now has 4 bits of available memory.
- At the 5^th second, 5 bits of memory are allocated to stick 1. The first stick now has 0 bits of available memory.
- At the 6^th second, the program crashes. The sticks have 0 and 4 bits available respectively.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `0 <= memory1, memory2 <= 2^31 - 1`

## Hints

1. What is the upper bound for the number of seconds?
2. Simulate the process of allocating memory.
