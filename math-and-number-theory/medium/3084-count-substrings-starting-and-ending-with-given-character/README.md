# 3084. Count Substrings Starting and Ending with Given Character

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Math, String, Counting
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-substrings-starting-and-ending-with-given-character/

## Description

You are given a string `s` and a character `c`. Return *the total number of substrings of *`s`* that start and end with *`c`*.*

**Example 1:**

**Input: **s = "abada", c = "a"

**Output: **6

**Explanation:** Substrings starting and ending with `"a"` are: `"**a**bada"`, `"**aba**da"`, `"**abada**"`, `"ab**a**da"`, `"ab**ada**"`, `"abad**a**"`.

**Example 2:**

**Input: **s = "zzz", c = "z"

**Output: **6

**Explanation:** There are a total of `6` substrings in `s` and all start and end with `"z"`.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
	- `s` and `c` consist only of lowercase English letters.

## Hints

1. Count the number of characters 'c' in string s, let’s call it m.
2. We can select 2 numbers i and j such that i  are the start and end indices of substring. Note that i and j can be the same.
3. The answer is m * (m + 1) / 2.

## Test Cases

```
"abada"
"a"
---
"zzz"
"z"
---
```
