# 2177. Find Three Consecutive Integers That Sum to a Given Number

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Math, Simulation
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-three-consecutive-integers-that-sum-to-a-given-number/

## Description

Given an integer `num`, return *three consecutive integers (as a sorted array)** that **sum** to *`num`. If `num` cannot be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers, return* an **empty** array.*

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** num = 33
**Output:** [10,11,12]
**Explanation:** 33 can be expressed as 10 + 11 + 12 = 33.
10, 11, 12 are 3 consecutive integers, so we return [10, 11, 12].
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** num = 4
**Output:** []
**Explanation:** There is no way to express 4 as the sum of 3 consecutive integers.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `0 <= num <= 10^15`

## Hints

1. Notice that if a solution exists, we can represent them as x-1, x, x+1. What does this tell us about the number?
2. Notice the sum of the numbers will be 3x. Can you solve for x?

## Test Cases
