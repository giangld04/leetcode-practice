**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Math
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/angle-between-hands-of-a-clock/

## Description

Given two numbers, `hour` and `minutes`, return *the smaller angle (in degrees) formed between the *`hour`* and the *`minute`* hand*.

Answers within `10^-5` of the actual value will be accepted as correct.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** hour = 12, minutes = 30
**Output:** 165
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** hour = 3, minutes = 30
**Output:** 75
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** hour = 3, minutes = 15
**Output:** 7.5
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= hour <= 12`
	- `0 <= minutes <= 59`

## Hints

1. The tricky part is determining how the minute hand affects the position of the hour hand.
2. Calculate the angles separately then find the difference.
