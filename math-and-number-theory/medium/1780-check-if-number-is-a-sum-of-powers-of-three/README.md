## Description

Given an integer `n`, return `true` *if it is possible to represent *`n`* as the sum of distinct powers of three.* Otherwise, return `false`.

An integer `y` is a power of three if there exists an integer `x` such that `y == 3^x`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** n = 12
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 12 = 3^1 + 3^2
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** n = 91
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 91 = 3^0 + 3^2 + 3^4
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** n = 21
**Output:** false
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 10^7`

## Hints

1. Let's note that the maximum power of 3 you'll use in your soln is 3^16
2. The number can not be represented as a sum of powers of 3 if it's ternary presentation has a 2 in it

## Test Cases

```
12

91
