# 2507. Smallest Value After Replacing With Sum of Prime Factors

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Math, Simulation, Number Theory
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-value-after-replacing-with-sum-of-prime-factors/

## Description

You are given a positive integer `n`.

Continuously replace `n` with the sum of its **prime factors**.

	- Note that if a prime factor divides `n` multiple times, it should be included in the sum as many times as it divides `n`.

Return *the smallest value *`n`* will take on.*

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** n = 15
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Initially, n = 15.
15 = 3 * 5, so replace n with 3 + 5 = 8.
8 = 2 * 2 * 2, so replace n with 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
6 = 2 * 3, so replace n with 2 + 3 = 5.
5 is the smallest value n will take on.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** n = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Initially, n = 3.
3 is the smallest value n will take on.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= n <= 10^5`

## Hints

1. Every time you replace n, it will become smaller until it is a prime number, where it will keep the same value each time you replace it.
2. n decreases logarithmically, allowing you to simulate the process.
3. To find the prime factors, iterate through all numbers less than n from least to greatest and find the maximum number of times each number divides n.
