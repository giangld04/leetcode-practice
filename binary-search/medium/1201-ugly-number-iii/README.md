## Description

An **ugly number** is a positive integer that is divisible by `a`, `b`, or `c`.

Given four integers `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, return the `n^th` **ugly number**.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** n = 3, a = 2, b = 3, c = 5
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10... The 3^rd is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** n = 4, a = 2, b = 3, c = 4
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12... The 4^th is 6.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** n = 5, a = 2, b = 11, c = 13
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** The ugly numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13... The 5^th is 10.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n, a, b, c <= 10^9`
	- `1 <= a * b * c <= 10^18`
	- It is guaranteed that the result will be in range `[1, 2 * 10^9]`.

## Hints

1. Write a function f(k) to determine how many ugly numbers smaller than k. As f(k) is non-decreasing, try binary search.
2. Find all ugly numbers in [1, LCM(a, b, c)] (LCM is Least Common Multiple). Use inclusion-exclusion principle to expand the result.
