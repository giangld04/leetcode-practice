# 3932. Count K-th Roots in a Range

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Math, Binary Search
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-k-th-roots-in-a-range/

## Description

You are given three integers `l`, `r`, and `k`.

An integer `y` is said to be a **perfect k^th power** if there exists an integer `x` such that `y = x^k`.

Return the number of integers `y` in the range `[l, r]` (inclusive) that are **perfect k^th powers**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** l = 1, r = 9, k = 3

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The perfect cubes in the range `[1, 9]` are:

	- `1 = 1^3`
	- `8 = 2^3`

Hence, the answer is 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** l = 8, r = 30, k = 2

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

The perfect squares in the range `[8, 30]` are:

	- `9 = 3^2`
	- `16 = 4^2`
	- `25 = 5^2`

Hence, the answer is 3.

**Constraints:**

	- `0 <= l <= r <= 10^9`
	- `1 <= k <= 30`

## Hints

1. Count how many perfect kth powers are at most r, then subtract how many are less than l.
2. For k >= 2, we can bruteforce the largest x such that xk  .
3. Be careful of edge case: k == 1.
4. Be careful of this edge case: l == 0.
